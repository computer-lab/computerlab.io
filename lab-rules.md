![Reference Lab Rules.](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/b5/56/89/b55689ffec09c9e77d39b12fffccc8cf.jpg)

### Code of Conduct:
- Computer Lab members will treat each other with kindness and respect.
- Computer Lab members will not "ghost" clients.

### Technical Procedures:
- For each project, we will create and maintain development, QA, and production environments.
- We will use a Continuous Integration server (Travis CI) to build, test, and deploy projects 
  automatically when code is pushed to GitHub. 
- We will create documentation on GitHub for important things (like this), and expose it via GitHub 
  pages if appropriate.
- We will work towards using Test Driven Development in order to consistently meet time and
  quality requirements.
