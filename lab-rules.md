### Guiding Principles:
- We are here to help you. 

### Code of Conduct:
- Computer Lab members will treat each other with kindness and respect.
- Computer Lab members will not "ghost" clients.

### Technical Procedures:
- For each project, we will create and maintain development, QA, and production environments.
- We will use a Continuous Integration server (Travis CI) to build, test, and deploy projects 
  automatically when code is pushed to GitHub. 
- We will create documentation on GitHub for important things (like this), and expose it via GitHub 
  pages if appropriate.
- We will work towards using Test Driven Development in order to more consistently meet time and
  quality requirements.

### Communication Procedures:

##### Internal Communication
- We will avoid using email as much as possible for internal communication. 
- We will use Slack and Twitter DMs for all internal project discussion. 
- We will use text and phone calls only for urgent issues. 

##### Client Communication
- Each project will have a single designated point of contact. All client communication should ideally go through this person.

### Canonical Things:

##### Hierarchy of Usernames
- @computerlab/computerlab
- @computer-lab/computer-lab 
- @computer_lab/computer_lab

##### Individual Member Usernames
- For member usernames, the member should use their first name (name@computerlab or name)

### Struggling and KMS

The Computer Lab sometimes appears to be a place where everyone constantly has an amazing time, is perfectly productive, and instantly makes new friends. In reality, many members are often thinking "I am going to KMS". This section exists to acknowledge the struggle of lab members and encourage everyone to seek support from the community for all kinds of problems and feelings.  Here are some of the things that Computer Lab members commonly struggle with.

Computer Lab members are sometimes lonely. They may have moved away from their friends and families to come to the Lab, and making new friends here takes time and energy. They're sometimes overwhelmed by meeting so many new people. Lab members sometimes feel guilty about spending time away from their children or other people they care for. If they have a long commute or a rigid schedule, they may feel excluded from after-hours social events.

Lab members sometimes feel that everyone else is being much more productive than they are. (This is often a manifestation of impostor syndrome.) It's easy to see only the people who are doing particularly well, but in reality everyone's productivity ebbs and flows.

Lab members sometimes struggle with the lack of structure. If you're coming from a more structured environment, expect this adjustment to be challenging at first.

Lab members sometimes struggle with mental health issues like depression. Smart, self-motivated people can have mental health issues, and there is no shame in getting support in dealing with them.

If you're struggling at the Computer Lab, you're not alone. You can reach out to facilitators, start a conversation on Slack or seek support from professionals. The Computer Lab community wants to help you.
