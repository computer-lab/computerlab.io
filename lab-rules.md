![Reference Lab Rules.](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/b5/56/89/b55689ffec09c9e77d39b12fffccc8cf.jpg)

### Guiding Principles:
- We are here to help you. 

### Code of Conduct:
- Computer Lab members will treat each other with kindness and respect.
- Computer Lab members will not "ghost" clients.

### Technical Procedures:
- For each project, we will create and maintain development, QA, and production environments.
- We will use a Continuous Integration server (Travis CI) to build, test, and deploy projects 
  automatically when code is pushed to GitHub. 
- We will create documentation on GitHub for important things (like this), and expose it via GitHub 
  pages if appropriate.
- We will work towards using Test Driven Development in order to more consistently meet time and
  quality requirements.

### Communication Procedures:

##### Internal Communication
- We will avoid using email as much as possible for internal communication. 
- We will use Slack and Twitter DMs for all internal project discussion. 
- We will use text and phone calls only for urgent issues. 

##### Client Communication
- Each project will have a single designated point of contact. All client communication should ideally go through this person.

### Canonical Things:

##### Hierarchy of Usernames
- @computerlab/computerlab
- @computer-lab/computer-lab 
- @computer_lab/computer_lab

##### Individual Member Usernames
- For member usernames, the member should use their first name (name@computerlab or name)

### Design Procedures:

### Business Procedures:
