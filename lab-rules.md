### Code of Conduct:
- Computer Lab members will not "ghost" clients.

### Technical Procedures:
- Create and maintain development (local), QA, and production environments.
- Continuous Integration server (Travis CI) builds, tests, and deploys to
  QA or production automatically on push to GitHub.
- Documentation is on GitHub (like this), and may also be deployed to pages for
  public-facing projects/libraries.
- Prefer test driven development.
