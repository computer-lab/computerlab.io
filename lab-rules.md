![Reference Lab Rules.](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/b5/56/89/b55689ffec09c9e77d39b12fffccc8cf.jpg)

### Code of Conduct:
- Computer Lab members will treat each other with kindness and respect.
- Computer Lab members will not "ghost" clients.

### Technical Procedures:
- Create and maintain development (local), QA, and production environments.
- Continuous Integration server (Travis CI) builds, tests, and deploys to
  QA or production automatically on push to GitHub.
- Documentation is on GitHub (like this), and may also be deployed to pages for
  public-facing projects/libraries.
- Prefer test driven development.
