# So You Want To Rent An Office

**Less-than-obvious things to consider when picking out office space:**

- How is the space accessed: how many keys do you get,
  or is there a keypad?  What is the policy for access?  Can
  your people get in when they want to?
  
- What is the quality of the windows?  Northern/Southern exposure?

- What is the heating/cooling system?

- Is there roof access?

- Noise levels at different times of the day.  Visiting the space
  during the day or on the weekend might not give you an accurate idea.

- Max amount of noise you'd be able to make: are families
  or other people nearby.
  
- Levelness of the floors.

- More obvious: if WiFi/Internet is provided, bring you phone and do a speedtest.
  Also check the security.  Again, consider the time of day.  Could you set
  up an Ethernet line to your office space for reliability?  Is the modem good?

- How thick are the walls, doors, etc?
