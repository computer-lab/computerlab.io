**Less-than-obvious things to consider when picking out an office space:**

How is the space accessed: how many keys do you get, or is there a keypad?  What
is the policy for access?  Can your people get in when they want to?
  
What is the quality of the windows?  Do the windows have a northern or southern
exposure?

What is the heating/cooling system?  What will the place be like during a
different season?

Is there roof access?

What are the noise levels at different times of the day?  Visiting the space
during the day or on the weekend might not give you an accurate idea of noise
during the week.

What would be the maximum amount of noise you'd be able to make?  Are families or
other people nearby?
  
Are the floors level?

More obvious: if WiFi/Internet is provided, bring you phone and do a speedtest.
Also check the security.  Again, consider the time of day.  Could you set up an
Ethernet line to your office space for reliability?  Is the modem good?

How thick are the walls, doors, etc?

Are there elevators that can be used to move heavy equipment or furniture into
the space?

Can you meet the super?  Do you like him or her?

Is there room for expansion?
