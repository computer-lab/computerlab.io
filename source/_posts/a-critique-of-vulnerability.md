__Four types of vulnerability that you shouldn't lean into.__

A culture where vulnerability is normalized can be exploited by a predatory
institution or individual, like a [millennial underwear

or an [alt
rapist](http://jezebel.com/member-of-queer-punk-band-pwr-bttm-accused-of-sexual-as-1795132781).
Predators often use vulnerability as a shortcut to, or a replacement for, a more
deserved connection. This is especially true in places like the startup and DIY
music scenes, where vulnerability and confessionalism permeate many aspects of
the culture. It’s unclear if these scenes have higher or lower rates of
predatory behavior, but it’s certainly the case that people seem more shocked
when instances of predatory behavior come to light in these spaces.

The idea of "leaning into vulnerability" may originate from a [massively
successful TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/brene_brown_on_vulnerability)
given by research professor Brene Brown, titled "The Power of Vulnerability." In
this talk, Brown says that we deal with insecurity by numbing feelings of
vulnerability, and we should fight this tendency by embracing these feelings
wholeheartedly. Over the past seven years this mindset has gone mainstream,
leading to "vulnerability" being celebrated regardless of context.

Perhaps we should be more wary of people who loudly brand themselves as
"harmless" or "sensitive". Why would someone need to publicly identify as
"gentle"? This also goes for people who broadcast their more uncouth impulses,
sexual or otherwise, while cushioning them with indicators of awareness and
coyness. The veneer of vulnerability and shame is what builds the trust of
onlookers.

Finally, what does "vulnerability" even mean: is it all about disclosing
secrets, taking social risks, feeling helpless, or a combination? We can
analyze different types of interpersonal vulnerabilty by thinking about the
dynamics at play.

### Modes of Interpersonal Vulnerability

#### Externally Induced mode

Vulnerability can be experienced in a private way.  For example, someone lost
in a forest feels helpless, isolated, and may act or think in ways that they
normally wouldn’t. Being lost, dealing with an emotionally abusive boss, or
going into combat would make a person feel vulnerable even if they were alone,
but when these situations are experienced with others, a whole different set of
vulnerabilities become relevant. Externally induced interpersonal vulnerability
occurs when powers beyond one’s control force a group of people to become
vulnerable with each other.

#### Weaponized mode

In recent years, awareness of tactics like
[negging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negging) and [love
bombing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_bombing) has increased. Both of
these tactics, when effective, trigger a vulnerability script that seeks a
resolution. Revealing personal intimacies or traumas establishes a feeling of
closeness that isn't necessarily justified. The victim of weaponized
vulnerability feels a need to match their behavior to the level of closeness
forced upon them. The weaponized mode of vulnerability, like MDMA, is a favorite
tool of rapists and abusers, and is often overlooked in cultures where
vulnerability is normalized.

#### As Small Talk mode

In some circles, sharing vulnerabilities is the easiest way to have a
conversation that isn’t about the weather. Talking about yourself is easy, and
in a group of uneasy people, confessing a vulnerability can quickly establish
rapport.

#### Performative mode

Performative vulnerability often lacks the malice of weaponized vulnerability,
but its main function is still a means to an end. In this mode, an individual
consciously or unconsciously manipulates systems of power to validate their
specific vulnerabilities, and a receptive, vulnerable audience feels validated
as well. Once a vulnerability has been elevated to the level of art or at least
relatable content, it becomes less of a vulnerability and more like an asset.

#### Mutual mode

The mutual mode of vulnerability simply lacks the pathologies of the modes
defined above. It’s an essential part of relationships and bonding, but also
tends to be unique across different relationships.

It's useful to look at situations where people experience vulnerability and
which mode they match best. For example, you may have heard of [“The 36
Questions That Lead to
Love”](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/11/fashion/no-37-big-wedding-or-small.html).
The questions originate from a 1997 study where professors paired up students
and asked them to take turns disclosing increasingly personal information. Much
has been made of the fact that the students reported 'significant
post-interaction closeness' regardless of agreement on important issues,
resulting in several improbable marriages.

While the reciprocal nature of the question and response format might appear
mutual, the fact that the study was arbitrarily imposed on students by
professors during a regular class session means that the dynamic during the
interaction would be best characterized as externally induced vulnerability.

The questions used in the study have since been widely circulated online for
use in team building or relationship counseling. It’s possible to imagine the
questions being used by a couple or group in a truly mutual way, but it’s
easier to imagine someone using the questions as a sort of elaborate pick up
line.

Because interpersonal vulnerability is so polymorphic, it's important to remain
suspicious of situations where you find yourself feeling vulnerable.  Blanket
celebration of "the power of vulnerability" is dangerous and unproductive, but
will probably always be appealing because, as Brene Brown writes on [her
homepage](http://brenebrown.com/), "vulnerability sounds like truth and feels
like courage." Compulsively disclosing vulnerabilities only makes sense as a
maladaptive coping mechanism for an environment of permanent psychological
insecurity.
