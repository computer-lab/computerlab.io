## Communication Procedures:

### Internal Communication
- We will use Slack and face-to-face for most internal project discussion. 
- We will use text and phone calls only for urgent issues. 

### Client Communication
- Each project will have a single designated point of contact. All client
  communication should ideally go through this person.
- That person should respond to the client promptly (ideally within 24 hours),
  even if the response is simply giving a time that they can render a full
  response.

### Technical Procedures:
- For each project, we will create and maintain appropriate development, QA, and
  production environments.
- We will create documentation on GitHub for important things (like this), and
  expose it via GitHub pages if appropriate.

## Canonical Things:

### Hierarchy of Usernames
- @computerlab/computerlab
- @computer-lab/computer-lab 
- @computer_lab/computer_lab

### Individual Member Usernames
- For member usernames, the member should use their first name (name@computerlab
  or name)

## Tools:

Here's a list of our software tools with information about how to access them.

### Slack
[Link](https://computer-lab.slack.com).

Slack is a chat service useful for discussing projects in detail.

Each general user costs $8/month.  General users can access all channels.

We can add people to a single channel for free, though.  This is useful for
clients or people who want to chat.  We can add up to 5 single-channel guests
per paid member.


### Harvest
[Link](https://computerlab.harvestapp.com).

Harvest is a time tracking service that can also be used to generate invoices
and estimates.

With the current plan, each additional user costs $10/month and we can create
unlimited clients/projects.

Perhaps we should use a more flexible time-tracking system, and move invoicing
into our accounting software.

### GitHub
[Link](https://github.com/computer-lab).

GitHub stores source code and documentation.

We don't have any private repositories yet.  5 private repos would be $20/month.

### Trello
[Link](https://trello.com/computer_lab).

Trello is for project managment.  We also keep our operations todo and 'sales
funnel' here.

We're on the free plan so far.

### Google Apps

Email and documents are provided by Google Apps.  It's also the place we should
store shared files.  Google Apps accounts are $5/month.

### Quickbooks / Xero

$ACCOUNTING_SOFTWARE is online accounting software that we use for managing
expenses, generating invoices, and running payroll.

We need to choose between Quickbooks and Xero.

Costs about $20-$30 a month.

### Bank Account

We have a business account at $BANK.  We can make deposits using the mobile app.
