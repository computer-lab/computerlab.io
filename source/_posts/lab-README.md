This is the README file for Computer Lab.  README files are typically included
with a piece of software so that people can quickly figure what the software
does, how to use it, and who to contact if there's a problem.  This README
aggregates key facts about Computer Lab so that important procedures, systems,
and standards are clear to all.  It's not comprehensive, but provides a good
starting point that eliminates fear, uncertainty, and doubt.

### Our Communication Procedures:

#### Internal Communication
- We use Slack and face-to-face for most internal project discussion. 
- We use text and phone calls only for urgent issues. 

#### Client Communication
- Each project has a single designated point of contact. All client
  communication should ideally go through this person.
- That person should respond to the client promptly (ideally within 24 hours),
  even if the response is simply giving a time that they can render a full
  response.

### Our Technical Procedures:
- For each project, we create and maintain appropriate development, QA, and
  production environments.
- We create documentation on GitHub for important things (like this), and expose
  it via GitHub pages if appropriate.

### Our Canonical Terms:

#### Hierarchy of Usernames
- `computerlab`
- `computer-lab`
- `computer_lab`

#### Individual Member Usernames
- For member usernames, the member should use their first name (`name@computerlab`
  or `name`)

### Our Tools:

Here's a list of our software tools with information about how to access them.

#### Slack

Our Slack is located at
[computer-lab.slack.com](https://computer-lab.slack.com).  Slack is a chat
service useful for discussing projects in detail.

Each general user costs $8/month.  General users can access all channels.

We can add people to a single channel for free, though.  This is useful for
clients or people who want to chat.  We can add up to 5 single-channel guests
per paid member.


#### Harvest

Our Harvest subdomain is [computerlab.harvestapp.com](https://computerlab.harvestapp.com).

Harvest is a time tracking service that can also be used to generate invoices
and estimates.

With the current plan, each additional user costs $10/month and we can create
unlimited clients/projects.

Perhaps we should use a more flexible time-tracking system, and move invoicing
into our accounting software.

#### GitHub
Our GitHub organization is located at [github.com/computer-lab](https://github.com/computer-lab).

GitHub stores source code and documentation.

We don't have any private repositories yet.  5 private repos would be $20/month.

#### Trello

Our Trello boards are located at [trello.com/computer_lab](https://trello.com/computer_lab).

Trello is for project managment.  We also keep our operations todo and 'sales
funnel' here.

We're on the free plan so far.

#### Google Apps

Email and documents are provided by Google Apps.  It's also the place we should
store shared files.  Google Apps accounts are $5/month.

#### Quickbooks / Xero

Accounting software is used for managing expenses, generating invoices, and
running payroll.

We need to choose between Quickbooks and Xero.

Both cost about $20-$30 a month.

### Bank Account

We need to open a bank account, probably at Capital One.  We can make deposits
using the mobile app.
