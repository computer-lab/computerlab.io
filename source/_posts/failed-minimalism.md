Are you a minimalist, or do you just have no taste?

Failed Minimalism is the practice of convincing oneself that a lack of design
choices is compelling and beautiful.  It's the process of cargo-culting
minimalist tropes and patting oneself on the back, even when you've made a mess.

Failed Minimalism has nothing to do with "Flat UI" or "Brutalist Web Design".
It's more a rhetorical strategy people use with themselves when they are afraid.

I'll use myself as an example.  Almost every time I've moved into a new place,
I've left the walls bare, thinking it was "minimalist".  I have always avoided
having a bunch of "things from my life" in my home, whether they be kitchen
supplies, special furniture, photos, etc.  Of course, soon things would start to
accumulate: necessary things from Ikea, stuff found in the trash, gifts, plants,
and little balls of hair and dust.  The ultimate result, even if I didn't
realize it, and even if it resembled the homes of many of my peers, was usually
a pretty awful place to live.

So what was I thinking?

You probably just associate minimalism with wealth because minimalism was
popular in the 80s, a period when cosmopolitan American wealth was widely
depicted and celebrated in the media.

I think that I was thinking that 

The amazing thing is that this kind of thinking can infect entire organziations,
even very successful ones with lots of resources.

Minimalism as a veneer, a defensive crouch.

Example One: Living and Working Spaces

Solutions to problems can also exhibit failed minimalism.  In the process of
cargo-culting the current minimalist design ethos, designers may force
themselves to hide the inherent essential complexity of the problem they are
trying to solve.  In my opinion, a good example of this is the design of many
software-as-a-service accounting software.  There's a 'intuitive user
interface' upon logging into the web application, but to do many routine
accounting tasks, one must find the 'advanced settings' section.  The front page
of the application creates the illusion of ... ultimately frustrating.

Example Two: Advertising

It's a symptom and cause of neoliberalism: if branding converges, products
become less differentiated, and the usual people win.

Example Three: Programming

Advertising.

Failed Minimalism is dangerous because it limits the human imagination.

It seems like Failed Minimalism is one of those things that people outgrow.  In
many ways it's almost characteristic of youth: the idea that there are 'more
important things'.  And sometimes, Failed Minimalism happens out of necessity.
Sometimes there aren't enough resources to do anything besides Failed
Minimalism.

In many ways it is a pretty easy anti-pattern to diagnose.
