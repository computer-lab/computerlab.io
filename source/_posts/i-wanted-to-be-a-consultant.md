When I was an exchange student in Taipei, an American friend of mine excitedly
told me about a quiet place he'd found on the bank of the Danshui river with a
bunch of public KTV machines and barbecue pits.  We were both very serious about
learning Mandarin, and believed that singing karaoke was a good way to overcome
our fear of speaking.

The KTV pavilions were scattered on the riverbank, among willow trees and
levees.  It took us a while to find a place that seemed inviting, and even
longer to work up the nerve to venture inside. 

We joined the people lounging in the shade, listening.  My friend finally asked
for the laminated songbook, and an older woman helped him find a song he knew.
I sang after him, singing my favorite Teresa Teng song.  I felt like I was the
better singer. 

After, we walked along the river, talking at length.  For the last time in my
life, I think, I discussed with someone the question of what I wanted to be
"when I grew up".  

I told my friend that I wanted to "have an office where I waited for people to
come in with problems, and then I would solve them."  

My friend told me that he thought my life dream was weird, and that he wouldn't
want a job like that.

"Fair enough," I said.

Another surreal memory is of a place in the Yamingshan mountains with an indoor
swimming pool full of giant shrimp.  

The proprietor gave each member of my host family a small fishing rod, and we
sat at the edge of the pool.  After putting the lure in the water, it generally
only took a few minutes to catch a shrimp.

A little boy was with us, and he laughed excitedly when a shrimp was caught.
They were about the size of my hands.  The shrimp were then covered in chunks of
salt and put through one of the metal conveyor belt toasters you typically see
at a hotel breakfast.  It was really delicious.
