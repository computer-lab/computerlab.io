__How Liu Cixin's science fiction novel may be a model for the relationship between autism and protracted crisis response strategies.__

In the beginning of "The Dark Forest", Liu Cixin's popular 2008 sci-fi novel,
humanity faces an existential threat from the Trisolarians, who have sent a
fleet of starships to colonize earth. The fleet won't arrive for four hundred
years, but sub-atomic surviellance devices called Sophons (intelligent
particles 知子) have already arrived, and are watching humanity attempt to assemble
some sort of response.

News of the impending invasion has slowly filtered its way through society:
politicians and military leaders meet in smoky rooms, other groups
(environmentalists, people traumatized by the Chinese Cultural Revolution)
grimly embrace the idea that humanity will no longer suffer on Earth. Some
people try to run financial speculation schemes to build ships that will escape
the solar system, but this is eventually banned by the UN as a form of
Defeatism.

Because Sophon particles are essentially in the room with military leaders,
transmitting any plans for defense back to the doomed Trisolarian homeworld, the
UN decides to try a crazy scheme. Because Sophons, powerful as they are, can't
read minds, the UN appoints four people to be "Wallfacers" (面壁者), keepers of
plans known to themselves, granted almost unlimited, unquestioned access to the
resources of the UN. Three of the four wallfacers attempt very clever, deeply
disturbing projects in hope of defeating the Trisolarians: a US general tries to
enlist the help of Osama Bin Laden in creating a kamikaze force, a charismatic
Venezuelan president builds massive atomic bombs he has sole control over, and a
British computer scientist develops a mind control device.

The Trisolarians, who continuously broadcast their thoughts electromagnetically
to their peers, and thus are incapable of private though, are terrified of the
Wallfacers. The Trisolarians use the Sophons to create VR games and manipulate
organizations and invididuals, which are eventually capable of (partially)
disrupting the plans of the Wallfacers. The US general commmits suicide, the
Venezuelan president is killed by his own angry people.

I think that the role of the Wallfacer in the fictional society of "The Dark
Forest" is somewhat similar to the role of autistic persons in today's real
world society. I also think there's signficant evidence in the book suggesting
that this similarity is intentional: for example, the homophonic and conceptual similarity
between the Chinese words for "Wallfacer" and "Autist": (mainbizhe 面壁者  / zibizhe 自闭者 lit. 'self-shut-in-person'),
and multiple mentions of autism or autistic characters in the text without any
significant plot purpose.

The final wallfacer, named Luo Ji (lit. "Logic"), is an underachieving
astronomer who happened to have met Ye Wenjie, the traumatized Chinese
scientists who made first contact with the Trisolarians, and essentially invited
them to colonize earth. He never wanted to be a wallfacer, and tries to get out
of the whole situation, but the trouble with being a wallfacer is you can't
quit: everyone just thinks that's part of your wallfacer plan. Luo Ji uses the
resources of the UN to build his dream home and find his dream wife, who
suprisingly actually falls in love with him. It's pretty creepy.

Humanity goes HAM trying to build a defense fleet despite Sophon interference.
Billions of people die as resources are dedicated to military projects. Luo Ji
and his family go into hibernation for hundreds of years, and when they wake up,
humanity has colonized the solar system and built all the classic sci-fi stuff:
underground cities, a massive space force etc. Humanity believes that they'll
defeat the 400-year-old Trisolarian fleet when it arrives in a few years.
Everyone has forgotten the wallfacer project, Luo Ji is looking forward to a
happy life with his wife and child when they wake up.

But then the first Trisolarian ship arrives and destroys most of the human fleet
in a few minutes.

Luo Ji, suddenly motivated to save himself and his family, has a sort of
psychotic break and thinks back to the words of Ye Wenjie. He realizes the "Dark
Forest" nature of the universe: resources are scarce in the vast darkness of the
universe, war is total and weaker civilizations are picked off and colonized as
soon as they broadcast their location in the darkness. He cobbles together parts
of all the old wallfacer plans, and creates a signal that would let the whole
universe know that Earth is a nice place, ready for colonization. He directly
addresses the Sophons in a sort of Mexican standoff and says that he'll trigger
the bat signal if the Trisolarian fleet comes any closer to earth. The
Trisolarians back down, and a sort of mutually assured destruction peace reigns.
This is the end of book two, a sort of "Empire Strikes Back" dark second part of
a trilogy.

Back to autism. What are the potential real world implications, especially
during this present crisis?

1) That people on the autism spectrum may be very valuable in creating +
executing plans in resource-constrained environments that might be socially
unacceptable in a broad sense, such as advising the public that masks are
unnecessary for the general population in order to ensure availability for
doctors. It's likely that autistic people, who often have a good understanding
of the implications of tail risks (
