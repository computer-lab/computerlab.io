__How Liu Cixin's science fiction novel may be a useful model for thinking about the role of autistic people during protracted crisis response situations.__

In the beginning of "The Dark Forest", Liu Cixin's popular 2008 sci-fi novel,
humanity faces an existential threat from the Trisolarians, who have sent a
fleet of starships to colonize earth. The fleet won't arrive for four hundred
years, but sub-atomic surveillance devices called Sophons (intelligent particles
知子) have already arrived, and are watching humanity attempt to develop a
response.

News of the impending invasion has slowly filtered its way through society:
politicians and military leaders are meeting in smoky rooms, other groups
(environmentalists, people traumatized by the Chinese Cultural Revolution)
grimly embrace the idea that humanity will be erased from Earth's surface. Some
people set up financial speculation schemes to fund the construction of ships
that will try escape the solar system, but this is eventually banned by the UN in an Anti-Defeatism Act.

Because Sophon particles are in the room with military leaders, transmitting any
plans for defense back to the doomed Trisolarian homeworld, the UN decides to
try a crazy scheme. Because Sophons can't read minds, the UN appoints four
people to be "Wallfacers" (面壁者), keepers of plans known to only themselves.
The Wallfacers are granted almost unlimited, unquestioned access to the
resources of the UN. Three of the four wallfacers attempt clever, disturbing
projects in hope of defeating the Trisolarians: a US general tries to enlist the
help of Osama Bin Laden in creating a kamikaze force, a charismatic Venezuelan
president builds massive atomic bombs he has sole control over, and a British
computer scientist develops a device that permanently "seals" beliefs in the
human mind.

The Trisolarians, who continuously broadcast their thoughts electromagnetically
to their peers and are incapable of private thought, are terrified of the
Wallfacers. The Trisolarians use the Sophons to create VR games that manipulate
organizations and individuals into disrupting the plans of the Wallfacers. The
US general commits suicide when his plan is revealed, the Venezuelan president
is killed by his own angry people. (He thinks the mob that kills him is about to
give him a heroes' welcome up to the very last moment.) 

I think that the role of the Wallfacer in the fictional society of "The Dark
Forest" is somewhat similar to the role of autistic persons in today's real
world society. I also think there's significant textual evidence suggesting
that this similarity is intentional: for example, the homophonic and conceptual similarity
between the Chinese words for "Wallfacer" and "Autist": (mainbizhe 面壁者  / zibizhe 自闭者 lit. 'self-shut-in-person'),
and multiple mentions of autism or autistic characters in the text without any
significant relevance to the overall plot.

The final Wallfacer, named Luo Ji (lit. "Logic"), is an underachieving
astronomer who once met Ye Wenjie, the traumatized Chinese scientist who made
first contact with the Trisolarians, and essentially invited them to colonize
earth. He never wanted to be a Wallfacer: he tries to get out of the whole
situation, but the trouble with being a Wallfacer is you can't quit: everyone
just thinks that's part of your secret Wallfacer plan. Luo Ji uses the resources of the
UN to build his dream home and find his dream wife, who surprisingly actually
falls in love with him. It's pretty creepy.

Humanity goes all-out trying to build a defense fleet despite Sophon interference.
Billions of people die as resources are dedicated to military projects. Luo Ji
and his family go into hibernation for hundreds of years, and when they wake up,
humanity has colonized the solar system and built all the classic sci-fi stuff:
underground cities, a massive space force etc. Humanity believes that they'll
defeat the 400-year-old Trisolarian fleet when it arrives in a few years.
Everyone has forgotten the Wallfacer project, Luo Ji is looking forward to a
happy life with his wife and child when they wake up.

But then the first Trisolarian ship arrives and destroys most of the human fleet
in a few minutes.

Luo Ji, suddenly motivated to save himself and his family, has a sort of
psychotic break and thinks back to the words of Ye Wenjie. He realizes the "Dark
Forest" nature of the universe: resources are scarce in the vast darkness of the
interstellar space, war is total and weaker civilizations are picked off and colonized as
soon as they broadcast their location in the darkness. He cobbles together parts
of all the old Wallfacer plans, and creates a signal showing the location of
Earth within the darkness, a nice place ready for colonization. He directly
addresses the Sophons in a sort of Mexican standoff and says that he'll trigger
his bat signal if the Trisolarian fleet comes any closer to earth. The
Trisolarians back down, and a sort of mutually assured destruction peace reigns.
This is the end of book two, the tragic "Empire Strikes Back" second part of
a trilogy.

Back to autism. What are the potential real world implications, especially
during this present, long-term crisis?

1) That people on the autism spectrum may be valuable in creating and executing
heartbreaking plans in resource-constrained situations, such as government
organizations advising the public that masks are unnecessary for the general
population in order to ensure availability for doctors. It's likely that
autistic people, along with other people have a good understanding of the
consequences of tail risks (ex: see [this
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxD-mU4cz20) where an autistic man who
works with his dad cutting trees talks about his concerns re: trees falling on
houses and people), were able to predict that these heartbreaking situations
would probably arise, expressed their concerns but these concerns were either
ignored or proper mitigations were not enacted. Autistic people are may be
valuable, but they vulnerable. In "Death's End", the volume following "The Dark
Forest", an autistic physicist who eventually commits suicide is described as an
"intellectual battery" used by the company he works for.

2) That rates of autism diagnosis are an important political factor in today's
world. In "Death's End", a character who is never explicitly described as
autistic, Yun Tianming, struggles during adolescence and adulthood. On the verge
of being "voluntarily euthanized" due to his terminal cancer, he receives a lump
sum of money from an old school friend he once gave a business idea to for free.
Instead of using the money to save his own life, he buys a star for his
childhood sweetheart, who then saves his life, but then sticks his brain into a
spaceship and shoots it at the Trisolarians in yet-another deranged scheme to
save humanity. Yikes. "Death's End" seems to make a number of subtle points
about the intersection of class, capital, romance, and autism. To put it
bluntly, privileged and powerful parents are better able to help their autistic
children find a good place in the world, while the autistic children of the
working class and the global poor suffer irrevocable trauma. Perhaps the rates
of autism diagnosis aren't really rising, it's more that good treatment for
autism is expanding. Slowly, inside the well-worn grooves of privilege and
power.

I have not studied autism in an academic setting, and in fact, I only really
started thinking about autism when I read these books last year and when people
I held in extremely high respect told me that they had been diagnosed with
autism. I was diagnosed with autism (or perhaps "aspergers") during a difficult
first year in college. At the time I thought it was a trick to get a leave of
absence (and perhaps it was...): my idea of a person with autism was based on middle
school experiences and stereotypes of people who like math and feel no emotion.
I barely tolerate math and tend to be overemotional, so I completely rejected
the diagnosis and didn't think about it again for almost a decade.

Autism can be seen as a close alignment with material reality, a fixation on the
dark forest of our universe as opposed to the social fabric of humanity. But
autism is not just an abstract lens to analyze character, it lives in the body,
causes embodied "side effects" that impair daily life. Good autism diagnoses, good autism
treatments, and good information about autism are a scarce resource that must
not be hoarded, especially now.

I've referenced Liu Cixin's popular work in an attempt to give readers common
ground as we all work to respond to this terrible crisis. I hope that
transparent discussions about autism and the role of autistic people in
organizations will lead to a safer, happier world for all.
