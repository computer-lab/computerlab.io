__How Liu Cixin's science fiction novel may be a model for the relationship between autism and protracted crisis response strategies.__

In the beginning of "The Dark Forest", Liu Cixin's popular 2008 sci-fi novel,
humanity faces an existential threat from the Trisolarians, who have sent a
fleet of starships to colonize earth. The fleet won't arrive for four hundred
years, but sub-atomic surviellance devices called Sophons (intelligent
particles 知子) have already arrived, and are watching humanity attempt to assemble
some sort of response.

News of the impending invasion has slowly filtered its way through society:
politicians and military leaders meet in smoky rooms, other groups
(environmentalists, people traumatized by the Chinese Cultural Revolution)
grimly embrace the idea that humanity will no longer suffer on Earth. Some
people try to run financial speculation schemes to build ships that will escape
the solar system, but this is eventually banned by the UN as a form of
Defeatism.

Because Sophon particles are essentially in the room with military leaders,
transmitting any plans for defense back to the doomed Trisolarian homeworld, the
UN decides to try a crazy scheme. Because Sophons, powerful as they are, can't
read minds, the UN appoints four people to be "Wallfacers" (面壁者), keepers of
plans known to themselves, granted almost unlimited, unquestioned access to the
resources of the UN. Three of the four wallfacers attempt very clever, deeply
disturbing projects in hope of defeating the Trisolarians: a US general tries to
enlist the help of Osama Bin Laden in creating a kamikaze force, a charismatic
Venezuelan president builds massive atomic bombs he has sole control over, and a
British computer scientist develops a mind control device.

The Trisolarians, who continuously broadcast their thoughts electromagnetically
to their peers, and thus are incapable of private though, are terrified of the
Wallfacers. The Trisolarians use the Sophons to create VR games and manipulate
organizations and invididuals, which are eventually capable of (partially)
disrupting the plans of the Wallfacers. The US general commmits suicide, the
Venezuelan president is killed by his own angry people.

I think that the role of the Wallfacer in the fictional society of "The Dark
Forest" is somewhat similar to the role of autistic persons in today's real
world society. I also think there's signficant evidence in the book suggesting
that this similarity is intentional: for example, the homophonic and conceptual similarity
between the Chinese words for "Wallfacer" and "Autist": (mainbizhe 面壁者  / zibizhe 自闭者 lit. 'self-shut-in-person'),
and multiple mentions of autism or autistic characters in the text without any
significant plot purpose.
