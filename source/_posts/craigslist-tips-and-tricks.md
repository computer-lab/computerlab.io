Craigslist is one of my favorite websites, it's always the first place I check whenever
I'm preparing to make a major purchase. Craigslist is a market dominated by arbitrage between 
buyers with extra time on their hands and sellers with better things to do. Those who can maximize
this oppurtunity will yield great results.     

### Searching For The Item


### Contacting The Seller

People who list things on Craigslist are amongst the laziest merchants on the internet. For any particular item there
are dozens of other online platforms that will fetch the seller a better price and offer a more secure sales setting. 
Nearly all sellers are using Craigslist because it is the path of least resistance for getting rid 
of something they no longer want, for most it is the final step before donating or throwing it out.  

Your objective is to make life for the seller as easy as possible. 

Do not call the seller's phone unless specifically requsted in the listing. Text if possible, or email if no number is provided.
As in all things in life, refrain from double-texting. If emailing, your email should be as succint as a single text message. 
Don't ask questions about the item unless necessary, if you have to ask questions, make sure they can be answered with a "Yes" or "No".
Don't complain or about an item in the hopes of negotiate the price lower. 

Make an offer that is significantly less than the seller's price, for me this is usually about half to two-thirds of the price. Tell them
you can pay in cash. Tell them you can pick up the item anytime in the next twenty-four hours somewhere convienint for them. 
If your offer is rejected or countered, simply say thanks and move on, in many cases they will get back to you in a day or two and accept your offer. 

If you're sending an email it's a good idea to include your phone number as well so they can reach you by phone if desired.

The ideal message should read like so:

> Hello, if this is still available I can meet you anytime today or tommorrow at a location convienient to you. I can offer *X dollars* in cash. Thanks.

### Buying The Item

I prefer to end all negotiation prior to meeting the seller.
At this step all that remains is the dance of greeting your seller, receiving the item and 
the subsequent counting and recounting of 20-dollar bills. There are some psychological tricks you 
can do at this stage to negotiate the price down even lower, but I feel they are unethical and have 
never attempted them myself, do so at your own discretion.
