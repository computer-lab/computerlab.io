Two Definitions, One Distinction.
======

On the necessity of shallow abstract categories to circumvent the prejudices of the researcher.

Person one: Did you enjoy talking with Taylor? They seem interesting. 
Person two: No, they dress well and went to Oberlin but are very boring. Taylor is an advanced basic.

Girl 1: "Wow she is so basic." 
Girl 2: "Nah, she does basic things because she likes them, not to fit in. She's advanced basic"

The following anthropology is an attempt to advance the basic tendency to assign substantial properties to **beings** in terms of predicates and attributes, i.e., to *define* people as *things*. Perhaps a radically negative approach is in order by creating categories of *distinction*: the method of creating of new contexts across the domain of being. 

Or to qualify, as a sense-making activity, that **form-of-life** from the quantifiable domain of its **lifestyle.**

Every lifestyle choice is a coping strategy, a means to overcome the basic fact that life is just basic -- and basic to the extent that it could do without us. 

What we will designate as *advanced basic* is the capability of operating withing the inescabable realm of basic-ness in a way that withstands any temptation to transcend it.

not sure whether or not i'm advanced bc i've been willingly colonized by a host apparatus that's instilled within me some false awareness of distinction, i.e., walking around like some kind of untitled aristocrat. P.L.U. vs people very much not like us

An Intelligence Without Traditions
======

In *The Future of Intellectuals and the Rise of the New Class,* Alvin Gouldner tracks the historical evolution of an international cultural elite. The New Class, according to Gouldner, is a rising demographic that seeks to delegitimize an older, traditional class by means of strategic leverage over the status-quo. This is an exclusively post-war phenomenon, a product of both the social upheavals of the civil rights era and the university-industrial complex, the hey-days of 1968. And though Gouldner's thesis applies directly to those of the boomer generation that managed to avoid, for men, the draft; or for women, the housewife's secondary status; the concept hasn't lost its relevance for those trying to figure out what the hell is going on today. You're in the New Class if you've been inculcated with the historical consciousness of the European Left, possess more (or more specialized) technical abilities than the generation prior to you, or can claim a certain amount of cultural capital that always seems to be inversely proportionate to the amount of money you make. 

Gouldner managed to nail a cultural bourgeosie whose motivations were neither entirely altruistic nor entirely economic, but who instead sought to find *meaning* in their position within the emerging world socio-economic order. The thesis is captured with a compelling acuity, but I don't believe anyone has captured the spirit of this phenomenon better than the novelist Elena Ferrante. 

The Neapolitan novels were published in English at around the same time the use of the term *basic* entered the American vernacular, between 2011 and 2014. The serial follows the lives of two women born in provincial Italy. The main character, Elena, is a "smart girl" who manages to escape her conditions by means of a university education-- only to return to her place of birth unable to speak the dialect under which she was born. The other woman, Lina, remains in Naples, a city she will never leave until she disappears into it. Lina works in a sausage factory and is subject to the most basic of domestic abuse, until she becomes a computer programmer thanks to an IBM correspondence course. Both women must emerge in relation to their role as second-class citizens, the basic circumstances of which they will never escape.

What makes this literature powerful is that it is the story of a politial education that takes place on the terrain of basic life. It's a story that has as much to do with the legacy of the nineteenth century as it does with the contradictions of the twentieth. Ferrante's world is populated by those trying to escape tradition, only to find themselves subject to the trappings of history. Her characters are caught somewhere between ideology and technology, they are themselves the becoming of a new, dialectical opposition. *"Whoever said,"* the scientist Lina demands of her humanist friend, *"that a life has to have meaning?"*
