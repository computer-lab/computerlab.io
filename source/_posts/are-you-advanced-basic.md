**What we will designate as *advanced basic* is the capability of operating withing the inescabable plane of basic in a way that withstands any temptation to transcend it.**

A History Without Traditions
=======

"This is a group of people that may have felt neglected in the past," said Noe Garcia III, a Republican volunteer dressed in non-NASCAR-like khakis and T-shirt. "We want to speak directly to them. We want them to know that we share many of the same values."


Had I really reached a point in my life where I was having more issues with my consciousness than with capitalism? Were my 20's really coming to a close? 

I'd taken to task the coming of age from an early start, probably too early: this might account for the pollution. Yes I was polluted with consciousness, my name is Just Short of 30 Under 30 and I admit I have a problem, I'm so under the influence of my thought I've literally transcended culture. 

It's a slippery slope from casually skimming the Verso aisle into full-blown radical theory. Before you know it you think you're the best card history's dealt. Look at you, you subject of consciousness, you organ of disillusionment. You're alienated. You dress like you smoke - casually,  without regard for the cost - which comes off like you know better- denim, canvas, deadstock cotton. You're woke but you're broke, you can see the Emporer for the clothes, but everything naked looks like a king. You get by with your charm and your cunning. You avoid crisis with deconstruction. What you lack in compassion you make up for in ideologic dexterity. What you lack in mobility you make up for in ambition, what you lack in ambition you make up for in flagrant cosmopolitanism. You are as bad at dating as you are good in bed. You're romantic, but wary of bourgeosie sentiment. Your emotions are subject to inflation, so you regulate with conceptual strife. You're sensitive to gluten. 








you are easily bored 





exhibit the kind of ideologic dexterity some would call 

You're affected by seasonal depression 

- but your thought has never been limited by means - and so denies any relationship to them, except the means by which you think, which is in stoic observance of the world. Of course you think the problem is systemic. You reject pronouns, both the ones assigned to you and pronouns in general. You're neurotic, but don't suffer nervous breakdowns: you only take the time to 'deconstruct.' 




ationalize class drag with dialectics. In leiue of never having your shit together, you become well versed in deconstructionist theory. You not only reject assigned programs, you reject pronouns entirely. You begin to inhabit your body as if no outside existed. You are an anthropology unto yourself; poor at networking, yet capable of small talk and "the expanded field," which includes visiting your parents. 

so-called actually-existing cultural Marxism and tracking vintage Lenin on ebay. You're cool, you dress like you smoke: casually and without regard for the cost. Or you dress like a materialist: denim, canvas, deadstock cotton. You dress like you know better than everyone else, because you're a historian, why keep up with style when it repeats? Reads Hegel once. Finds love on dating app, never. 

You desire to engage in political conduct, yet you find social justice unconvincing, because you know under capitalism there can be no justice. 

Well it's all downhill from there: the deconstruction, the flagrant cosmpolitanism, the kernel of privilege within exploitation. If your You're broke, but you're woke.

enough to stretch your intellect beyond your means. 

You start to wonder why the only people who are alienated are the ones who read. 



flagrant cosmpolitanism. 



For me it was a slippery slope from casually skimming over the Verso section at the Barnes & Noble into full-blown radical theory, and then into very serious theory, after which it was all downhill into deconstruction from there. I was immune to things like jobs and boutique spirituality- something my Lacanian analyst probably only knows the full extent of- though not entirely opposed to religion, which I took seriously as a space where reason could be leveraged in the name of surrender. 

to leverage reason in the face of surrender. 




as a serious opportunity to surrender reason in the name of intensity. 

people are such spirituality junkies? 

yoga, buddhism, or domestic monogamy, and if it weren't for the Althusser, I'd probably take moralistic therapeutic deism more seriously. If I was going to get into some California Ideology shit, I was going to go straight to the heart of what ideology really is: a useful tool. 

It shouldn't come as a suprise that here in the Matrix or New York City or wherever this is, nobody has to wait for a breakthrough. They can scrape up $700 and buy it.

Structurally, the price of the course

Why wait for a breakthrough when you can import it straight from the Silicon Valley to the asshole of Midtown Manhattan? I draw the line at Scientology and colonics. 



Rehab was an option, but drugs weren't even as much as a problem as I found myself to be. Neither was money, and pretty much any other circumstancial approach I was using to excuse myself from the 

I felt the $700 to be more than worth it. I live in New York City. You can buy anything here, 

About 16 hours into a notorious personal development seminar and I realized how basic I actually was. I'd gotten over early on the chainsaw motivational dialect, the flat shove of the florescents, whatever unpalatable semantic infrastructures that make a self-help campaign what it really is. At a certain point, I found myself beyond judgement. I found myself beyond everything.  

Ideology truly has no history; that's how we survive it. The course was designed to restructure usually hard-earned catharses into a casual domino-effect of personal and professional breakthroughs-- naturally delivered within some kind of highly-specific linguistic prison-house-- for a duration of 65 near-straight hours. So of course a few friends put me on cult watch. I'd read enough Althusser to understand that ideology is something you either use or get used by, it has nothing to do with belief. 

The baggage I'd come in with had slowly distilled into a Bloom-esque bliss, the drama of the ego having been quickly vanquished by the Neoliberal miasma of infinite potential.

200 other suckers in the room. It began with the realization that I'd staked my entire social life on a petty rule about shoes, and barrelled into, about once every 90 minutes, variations on the same cathartic phenomenon: the world is empty, and so are you. Be free. 

I don't usually buy-in to this sort of thing, but when I do, it's usually on the level of both the expensive and the profane. Or in this case, maybe both: the company's Yelp reviews either cast the experience as "life-changing, so powerful it should be illegal" to "this should be illegal." However much it cost, it was cheaper than how I'd been living, and it's not like the pharmaceutical industry had proven any less Faustian. 

I'd already prepared myself for an unpalatable stretch of 13 hour days and the light CBT, the emptying out of myself and my problems into the miasma of "infinite potential." 

that are as expensive as others claim to be profane. 


to me that I'd staked my entire social life on shoes, my well-being on a culture industry that I'd mistaken for a culture, and myself on that which does not exist, that is, ideas. 




. It occured to me that I'd staked my entire social life on shoes. I'm not sure what it was - the chainsaw motivational dialect, the flattened edge of the florescently lit room, the undeniable charisma of the coach - 

The shoes sitting next to me looked like an 
asshole, curbing ear with the suit beside him on how the speaker was really motivating him. I'd prepared myself for something
I believed unpalatable, yet necessary: this was new york city, this was the matrix, you can get anything here, why look for a

Are you Advanced Basic? If you answered 'yes' to that question, then probably not. 

The New Native
======


I hosted an internet-based public volunteer computer project employing the BOINC software platform created by the Berkely SETI Research Center with the intention of cross-referencing qualitative data obtained from the dating platform Feeld. 


Do you find yourself at the void of everything?

The Search for Intelligent Life
======

> The following anthropology is an attempt to advance the basic tendency to assign substantial properties to **beings** in terms of predicates and attributes, i.e., to *define* people as *things*. 

Perhaps a radically negative approach is in order by creating categories of *distinction*: the method of creating of new contexts across the domain of being.

Person two: No, they dress well and went to Oberlin but are very boring. Taylor is an advanced basic.

Two images call to mind the face of 1999.

One is of Chloe Sevigny, the face of the multitude. 

The other is the face of Seattle. Queue fog machine. In Art Club 2000's iconic photographs, strains of kids languidly occupy a living room setting and from there disappear into the streets of the mall. It is very clear we are somewhere in New York, but also somewhere else. Perhaps somewhere close to the vaccuum left in the wake of the systematic smashing of a Starbucks window during the 1999 GTO protests. 

Is this the effect of the Millenium Bug?

Two definitions, One distinction.
=====

Every lifestyle choice is a coping strategy, a means to overcome the basic fact that life is just basic -- and basic to the extent that it could do without us. It's a story that has as much to do with the legacy of the nineteenth century as it does with the contradictions of the twentieth. 

```
The Neapolitan novels were published in English at around the same time the use of the term *basic* entered the American vernacular, between 2011 and 2014. The serial follows the lives of two women born in provincial Italy, and who come of age against the political upheavals of 1968. The main character, Elena, is a "smart girl" who manages to escape her conditions by means of a university education-- only to return to her place of birth unable to speak the dialect under which she was born. The other woman, Lina, remains in Naples, a city she will never leave until she disappears into it. Lina works in a sausage factory and is subject to the most basic of domestic abuse, until she becomes a computer programmer thanks to an IBM correspondence course. Both women must emerge in relation to their role as second-class citizens, the basic circumstances of which they will never escape.

Alvin Gouldner tracks the historical evolution of such an international cultural elite. His 1979 tractatus *The Future of Intellectuals and the Rise of the The New Class* describes a rising demographic that seeks to delegitimize an older, traditional class by means of strategic leverage over the status-quo. You're in the New Class if you've been inculcated with the historical consciousness of the European Left, possess more (or more specialized) technical abilities than the generation prior to you, or can claim a certain amount of cultural capital that always seems to be inversely proportionate to the amount of money you make. This is an exclusively post-war phenomenon, a product of both the social upheavals of the civil rights era and the university-industrial complex. 
```

After Gouldner managed to nail a cultural bourgeosie whose motivations were neither entirely altruistic nor entirely economic, what arose was the story of those, instead, who sought meaning from their position within the emerging world socio-economic order. It's a world populated by those trying to escape tradition, only to find themselves subject to the trappings of history. 

We find ourselves caught somewhere between ideology and technology; we are the becoming of a new, dialectical opposition.

A View From the Periphery to the Mob
======

I began by asking people on Feeld if they resemble their profiles. Why doesn't anyone find this as funny as I do? 

As a pickup line this has not proved very workable - I guess people think I'm asking whether or not their photos are real? This line of thought is also amusing, at least to me. 


![img_389a69e6c2ef-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28285201/37328129-5ee92770-266f-11e8-838c-68220f3e5bf1.jpeg)

We could map out a demographic plane of consistency that lacks the claim to any one form of cultural distinction. *The spectre of the majority.*


The photograph on the card is a bleach-stained image of a woman of uncertain origin, uncertain character. Hair of an uncertain brown. Her eyebrows are plucked then like the stress-marks above vowel, pronunciation marks. 

Before I was of age I used Stephanie Castaneda as an alias to get into bars. Of course, having to slouch slightly as to better conform my 5'7 to a strangers 5'4. Since when do we resemble our representations, isn't it supposed to be the other way around, don't just memorize the day and month on your fake ID - a smart doorman will ask your zodiac sign.

Basic is a regulatory procedure that sets the parameters for divergence. This is why basic is iterated most deeply in its alternatives - feminists, underdogs, queers, outliers. The Whatever freshness of singularity and youth. There's nothing more basic than being yourself, which is a process of gentrification that begins in adolescence and ends only when you're no longer a consumable. 

*Rapid prototyping is the new existentialism.*

Public policy measures visibility. Not just facial recognition (racial recognition) but a catalogue measure of faces and spaces, organized in the cultural imagination as a means to divide and ensemble. 

Therefore our strategy is to look as distinct as one appears anonymous.

I chose the user Ines, for inessential. There's nothing personal about this, but then again, it's a *personals* ad. Ines finds it necessary to retain an element of the undiscovered.
