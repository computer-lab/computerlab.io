Two Definitions, One Distinction.
======

On the necessity of shallow abstract categories to circumvent the prejudices of the researcher. 


UD defines *Advanced Basic* as recognizeably different from *basic*. Though opposed, both involve acting and thinking in ways that converge on existing referents: 

```
Person one: Did you enjoy talking with Taylor? They seem interesting. 
Person two: No, they dress well and went to Oberlin but are very boring. Taylor is an advanced basic.

Girl 1: "Wow she is so basic." 
Girl 2: "Nah, she does basic things because she likes them, not to fit in. She's advanced basic"

Advanced basic could describe a modality of self-expression that arises out of an active engagement with normative behavior, a means of dislocating identity and positioning the self above any singular mode of social participation. In this sense, the emergence of the advanced basic might have more in common with the biblical treatise of being “in the world, yet not of it” than it does with any historical avant-garde. 

The following anthropology is an attempt to advance the basic tendency to assign substantial properties to **beings** in terms of predicates and attributes, i.e., to *define* people as *things*. Perhaps a radically negative approach is in order by creating categories of *distinction*: the method of creating of new contexts across the domain of being. 

Or to qualify, as a sense-making activity, that **form-of-life** from the quantifiable domain of its **lifestyle.**

Every lifestyle choice is a coping strategy, a means to overcome the basic fact that life is just basic -- and basic to the extent that it could do without us. 

What we will designate as *advanced basic* is the capability of operating withing the inescabable realm of basic-ness in a way that withstands any temptation to transcend it.

not sure whether or not i'm advanced bc i've been willingly colonized by a host apparatus that's instilled within me some false awareness of distinction, i.e., walking around like some kind of untitled aristocrat. P.L.U. vs people very much not like us

An Intelligence Without Traditions
======

In *The Future of Intellectuals and the Rise of the New Class,* Alvin Gouldner tracks the historical evolution of an international cultural elite. The New Class, according to Gouldner, is a rising demographic that seeks to delegitimize an older, traditional class by means of strategic leverage over the status-quo. This is an exclusively post-war phenomenon, a product of both the social upheavals of the civil rights era and the university-industrial complex, the hey-days of 1968. And though Gouldner's thesis applies directly to those of the boomer generation that managed to avoid, for men, the draft; or for women, the housewife's secondary status; the concept hasn't lost its relevance for those trying to figure out what the hell is going on today. You're in the New Class if you've been inculcated with the historical consciousness of the European Left, possess more (or more specialized) technical abilities than the generation prior to you, or can claim a certain amount of cultural capital that always seems to be inversely proportionate to the amount of money you make.

Gouldner managed to nail a cultural bourgeosie whose motivations were neither entirely altruistic nor entirely economic, but who instead sought to find *meaning* in their position within the emerging world socio-economic order. The thesis is captured with a compelling acuity, but I don't believe anyone has captured the spirit of this phenomenon better than the novelist Elena Ferrante. 

The Neapolitan novels were published in English at around the same time the use of the term *basic* entered the American vernacular, between 2011 and 2014. The serial follows the lives of two women born in provincial Italy. The main character, Elena, is a "smart girl" who manages to escape her conditions by means of a university education-- only to return to her place of birth unable to speak the dialect under which she was born. The other woman, Lina, remains in Naples, a city she will never leave until she disappears into it. Lina works in a sausage factory and is subject to the most basic of domestic abuse, until she becomes a computer programmer thanks to an IBM correspondence course. Both women must emerge in relation to their role as second-class citizens, the basic circumstances of which they will never escape.

What makes this literature powerful is that it is the story of a politial education that takes place on the terrain of basic life. It's a story that has as much to do with the legacy of the nineteenth century as it does with the contradictions of the twentieth. Ferrante's world is populated by those trying to escape tradition, only to find themselves subject to the trappings of history. Her characters are caught somewhere between ideology and technology, they are themselves the becoming of a new, dialectical opposition. *"Whoever said,"* the scientist Lina demands of her humanist friend, *"that a life has to have meaning?"*

Though I hardly qualify as basic, I'm not sure if I meet the standards for advanced, either. 

Case in point: summer of 2015, a rather orthodox frat party. I was two, maybe three, jello shots into *basic* territory, the likes of which I'd never experienced.  I didn't really go to college, but even so, I thought of myself as a worldly person. The kind of person who could party with anyone, and do so just about anywhere. At the time I'd recently returned from a modeling tour across Europe, a three-month slew of gigs and nightclubs; I figured myself to be as well acquainted with my own limits as I was with the craft of looking like I belonged anywhere. That the shots lacked the usual chaser of irony may have accounted for the weirdness. I may have been a cosmopolitan sin, but no match for middle America. 

Drunken PDA's, drugstore top-40, bad sex elevated to the level of ritual. It was under the natty lights and against my oncoming headache-- ensured by the sugary shots and warm keg beer-- in a generic off-campus student housing development, that I became as foreign as I'd ever been in any place I've yet to see in this world. It struck me as a miracle that someone as linguistically competent as I was could come off as so alienating. The rapidly shifting flow of references, slurs, inside jokes, *that one time at Coachella*; at every moment, the mimicry of a gesture I hadn't caught, a new party game that I couldn't keep up with. I lived in New York, I hadn't had a TV in years, maybe we watched something nostalgic or intelligent on Netflix, either way, the reality of reality television was not my reality. Suddenly I understood what it probably felt like for my parents. My sentences were too long, my vocabulary, stale. 

*Yo girl,* someone called out, *why you gotta get so deep.* 

I was forced to comprehend the limits of myself. Clearly, I was some sort of replicant and not Greek-life material. I was the object of attention, but not the kind of attention I could navigate easily. My only saving grace was a pair of blocky stilletto's-- the kind that made me look like a Bratz doll from the knees down-- that had been lent to me by one of the more sympathetic girls I'd arrived with. 

It occured to me, then, that I possessed about as much cultural diversity as the outside of an American Apparel bag. Frankfurt, Los Angeles - it didn't matter where I was, I moved seamlessly across a plane of social consistency that rarely changed, despite the accelerated turnover of its trends. Mine was a world populated with appearances, but also by people who were aware of those appearances, and I was used to being surrounded by those who were as socially conscious as they were socially mediated. To be at the effect of what I was wearing, rather than for what I was wearing to be at the effect of me, was a strange and disorienting loop. It was never concluded whether or not I was over-dressed or under-dressed for the occaision, but it was implied that my "taste" could potentially compromise the moral integrity of the group. 

I'd accepted the heels as a form of community service. Even so, my faux-pas began to stack up quickly. After I'd elected to dance with three different fuccboi's in a row, with no intention of continuing the interaction beyond *Sexy's Got Back*, I knew I'd crossed the line into pariah territory. When someone called me an uptight little slut, I left to go find the back room, where somebody had to be doing drugs. Figuring that getting high would at least put me on some kind of common ground with the plebes, however private the experience. 

It should be understood that the basic has nothing to do with intelligence. It isn't a question of being smart or dumb, but of how well one can operate without compromising a predetermined threshold of engagement. The 22 year old who cut adderall in front of me with the Macy's gift card he'd received for graduation should be, by now, well into a very lucrative career. I was partying at one of the highest-ranked medical schools in the country. To say nothing of fuccboi's or basic bitches: everyone there was a doctor.
