Are you Advanced Basic? If you answered 'yes' to that question, then probably not.

I hosted an internet-based public volunteer computer project employing the BOINC software platform created by the Berkely SETI Research Center with the intention of cross-referencing qualitative data obtained from the dating platform Feeld.

It is possible that we find ourselves, once again and always already, up against the gravitational pull that is the void of identity. <img align="right" width="100" height="100" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28285201/37325423-3e3c8c0c-2664-11e8-9e1f-2bb60c389020.jpg">

The Search for Intelligent Life
======

> The following anthropology is an attempt to advance the basic tendency to assign substantial properties to **beings** in terms of predicates and attributes, i.e., to *define* people as *things*. 

Perhaps a radically negative approach is in order by creating categories of *distinction*: the method of creating of new contexts across the domain of being. 

**What we will designate as *advanced basic* is the capability of operating withing the inescabable realm of basic-ness in a way that withstands any temptation to transcend it.**

> We attempt to qualify, as a sense-making activity, that **form-of-life** from the quantifiable domain of **lifestyle.**

Person one: Did you enjoy talking with Taylor? They seem interesting. 
Person two: No, they dress well and went to Oberlin but are very boring. Taylor is an advanced basic.

A History Without Traditions

Two images call to mind the face of 1999.

One is of Chloe Sevigny, the face of the multitude. 

The other is the face of Seattle. Queue fog machine. In Art Club 2000's iconic photographs, strains of kids languidly occupy a living room setting and from there disappear into the streets of the mall. It is very clear we are somewhere in New York, but also somewhere else. Perhaps somewhere close to the vaccuum left in the wake of the systematic smashing of a Starbucks window during the 1999 GTO protests. 

Is this the effect of the Millenium Bug?

Two definitions, One distinction.
=====

*"Whoever said," the scientist Lina demands of her humanist friend, "that a life has to have meaning?*

Because every lifestyle choice is a coping strategy, a means to overcome the basic fact that life is just basic -- and basic to the extent that it could do without us. It's a story that has as much to do with the legacy of the nineteenth century as it does with the contradictions of the twentieth. 

```
The Neapolitan novels were published in English at around the same time the use of the term *basic* entered the American vernacular, between 2011 and 2014. The serial follows the lives of two women born in provincial Italy, and who come of age against the political upheavals of 1968. The main character, Elena, is a "smart girl" who manages to escape her conditions by means of a university education-- only to return to her place of birth unable to speak the dialect under which she was born. The other woman, Lina, remains in Naples, a city she will never leave until she disappears into it. Lina works in a sausage factory and is subject to the most basic of domestic abuse, until she becomes a computer programmer thanks to an IBM correspondence course. Both women must emerge in relation to their role as second-class citizens, the basic circumstances of which they will never escape.

Alvin Gouldner tracks the historical evolution of such an international cultural elite. His 1979 tractatus *The Future of Intellectuals and the Rise of the The New Class* describes a rising demographic that seeks to delegitimize an older, traditional class by means of strategic leverage over the status-quo. You're in the New Class if you've been inculcated with the historical consciousness of the European Left, possess more (or more specialized) technical abilities than the generation prior to you, or can claim a certain amount of cultural capital that always seems to be inversely proportionate to the amount of money you make. This is an exclusively post-war phenomenon, a product of both the social upheavals of the civil rights era and the university-industrial complex. 
```

After Gouldner managed to nail a cultural bourgeosie whose motivations were neither entirely altruistic nor entirely economic, what arose was the story of those, instead, who sought meaning from their position within the emerging world socio-economic order. It's a world populated by those trying to escape tradition, only to find themselves subject to the trappings of history. 

We find ourselves caught somewhere between ideology and technology; we are the becoming of a new, dialectical opposition.
