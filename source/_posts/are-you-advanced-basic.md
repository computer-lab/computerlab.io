```basic``` is a system of predicate relations in which ```self``` is an enclosing object and ````I```` is a procedural force that can generate instance ````self````.  ```breed``` function symbolically mediates complicity between self-referential objects within the matrix and dominant language models. see also ```abstract factory```. 

> *Each body wants to exhaust its form-of-life and leave it for dead. Then, it passes on to another. This is how a
body gets thicker, nourished with experience. But it also becomes more supple: it has learned how to get rid of one
figure of the self.* [citation needed]

  ## Are you advanced ```basic```? It depends how far you're willing to go to get over yourself. 

Every lifestyle choice is a coping strategy, a means to overcome the basic fact that life is just basic, and basic enough to exist beyond us. ```advbasic``` defines any instance beyond the usual subject/object melodramas, which have only ever been the mediation of reality through representation. ```universal basic equivalence```: not just capitalism but the entire framework of perception. In cartesian logic, ```being``` emerges as an attribute of consciousness, rather than the intimacy between knowledge and perception. Nobody exists in thought — but in ```basic``` terms, we survive there. 



``` Create object 
  cartesian subject  basic.basic  also nuclear.basic``` 
```


```basic``` is an existential programming construct that circumscribes the self in an intelligent machine logic, so that the only possibilities for being are those at the most base level of interpretation. What's left is ```identity``` as a *compromise*, the result of an inability to reconcile oneself with the very objectivity through which your code was originally executed. ```Identity``` is defined as both a state of separation and a solution to connection, as well as a necessary function of the social order. There’s nothing more ```basic``` than being yourself, which is essentially gentrification elevated to the level of a formal perspective. 

```being yourself```encapsulates all the shit we pile onto our experience, the resigned cynicism that populates our intelligence, the rackets we run as social relationships, all the lies we've earned to tell through a certain kind of participation in culture, the creativity behind our strife, great jobs, etc — basically, whatever hides us from the sense that *we’re living beyond our means, and that what it means is something we'll never live up to.*  

```Basic``` **over-represents itself and features a surplus of identity**. A formalized pattern that operates as a security environment against the threat of the ```vulnerable.``` 

The ```basic``` is a mccarthyist predeliction aimed at ostracizing those who are a bit *too* socially mediated. The vernacular sense of the term  ```basic```  is the result of a compilation of phobias triggered by anyone who isn’t *expressing their tru self* at all costs, i.e.,  circulating as a fixed referent in relation to the dominant modes of value-formation. 

A tendency of ```basic``` is to produce non-value producing value statements -- self/other, good/bad, like/dislike, worth it/not worth it, us/them, fake/real and so on.  Within this paradigm, relationships become non-consensual sub/dom relationships pre-programmed for exchange across the abstract plane of the economic. 

```advbasic``` isn’t about degentrifying the personal from consumer infiltration, or pop culture, or whateverdomination-- instead presents an alternative model to artifical humanism and possibly the only way through. see ```existential terrorism```. 


```
define: basic if{ chain purses, couples, meaningful tattoos, lace-up boots with zippers, identity politics, coachella, aspirant productivity, virtual militarization, spectator terrorism, kink, social justice startups, critical theory, legacy activism, schizophrenic feminism, #metoo, glamping, the alt-right, marxism, personal development, sonograms of unborn children circulating via facebook posts about your 'natural birth', breakdowns, fake news, diversity -> variety, preferences, finding yourself, finding the one, young creatives, social media crypto, consumer holidays, normativity, non-normativity, permaculture, lit hum, failed minimalism, cops, going out 

```

The paradox is that there's nothing more ```basic``` than focusing in on the pejorative sense of the term. You're ```basic``` if you're still flagging the ```fuccboi``` you met last night, the one with the ```baby voice```, if you're still participating in elective victimhood, or conscious capitalism, whichever side of the ongoing taste wars you're in the mood for. Far from constituting an ```exit``` strategy from a virtual reality whose signifier is everywhere and referent nowhere - this is participation on the most ```basic level,``` i.e., ```trolling```. 

```
define representational.politics 

My body is not an object(I have the right to own myself.)
  $I am who I am. 
  
```
Various semantic glitches ensue, which require the ```social deviance``` patch to run. 

```basic.attribute {normalized deviance}```

```basic``` is an inheritance model in which ```identity``` is a secure, self-referencing system. With the goal of having the kind of referential stability capable of outliving any humanity, including the one that produced it. ```basic``` defines profiles without users, any personality that seems to be abstracted from any one person. The only thing personal is property, and, as we all know, property is an attribute of objects. Thus the advanced distinction```advbasic``` as **particularity**, thereby overwriting personality as necessary to social survival.  

```define: advbasic when{ particle physics, uncertainty principle```

```advbasic``` is being with no reason for being, and the only thing that has no reason for being is power.

```advbasic``` isn’t a description logic: we’re not trying to develop the right interpreters, capable of processing the endless compilations of signs passing for culture these days, this would be a complete waste of time. Probably on par with critical theory, or consciousness raising. 

If the ```basic``` could be looked at as encryption - an artificial intelligence modeled after the european enlightenment, which didn’t so much liberate subjects than it did objects - then ```advbasic``` is decryption. It is anti-transcendential because that's how you hack shit. 

```advbasic``` is high level semantics for fun and profit. A means of figuring out not *what something is, but how it is — and the strategic programming of possibilities from there.
