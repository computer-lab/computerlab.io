## Are you advanced basic? 

If you answered “yes” to that question, then probably not. If the basic can be construed as an ever-adapting, yet never evolving, status quo unconscious of itself as such, any attempt at cultural resistance is futile. You’re advanced basic if you can operate within this realm in a way that withstands any temptation to transcend it— and, at the same time, refuse to surrender to the logic of its conformity. 

The definition of the advanced basic, via Urban Dictionary, describes “someone who has the appearance and knowledge of someone deeply involved with culture, but who has the basic attitude.” The second definition, slightly less popular, appears at first as a direct contradiction: “someone who acts very basic, but *does not have the basic attitude.* 

Advanced basic is a semantic paradigm, rather than just another identitarian trend. It's here that we can avoid the danger of over-simplification. Is the concept of advanced basic an attempt to reclaim/re-appropriate the basic, territorially motivated, like any other form of identity politics? Or can our engagement with the language point towards a way out, a means by which to *politicize* identity?

Advanced basic could describe a modality of self-expression that arises out of an active engagement with normative behavior, a means of dislocating identity and positioning the self above any singular mode of social participation. In this sense, the emergence of the advanced basic might have more in common with the biblical treatise of being “in the world, yet not of it” than it does with any historical avant-garde. 

In *The Future of Intellectuals and the Rise of the New Class,* the late sociologist Alvin Gouldner tracks the historical evolution of the cultural elite. Gouldner pinpoints the New Class as a rising demographic that seeks to delegitimize an older, traditional class through a strategic leveraging of the status-quo. This is a post-war phenomenon, a product of both the social upheavals of the civil rights era and the university-industrial complex. And though his thesis applies directly to those of the boomer generation that managed to avoid, if you were a man, the draft; a woman, secondary status as a housewife; the concept hasn't lost its relevance for those trying to figure out what the hell is going on today. You're in the New Class if you've been inculcated with the historical consciousness of the European Left, possess more (or more specialized) technical abilities than the generation prior to you, or can claim a certain amount of cultural capital that always seems to be inversely proportionate to the amount of money you make.

Though I hardly qualify as basic, I'm not sure if I meet the standards for advanced, either. Case in point: in 2015, I found myself at my first ever frat party. I was 25, and hadn't spent much time in college, at least formally-- by this time my circulation within a certain elite, academic milieu forfeited any purpose, let alone desire, I may have had for the endeavor. And so I thought of myself as a worldly person. The kind of person who could party with anyone, and do so just about anywhere. I'd recently returned from a modeling tour across Europe, a three-month slew of gigs and nightclubs, so I was well acquainted with the practice of knowing my limits and looking like I belonged wherever it was that I was. 

This, however, would be my first time in middle America. I was two, maybe three jello shots in. These had been served to me without the usual chaser of irony, and might have explained the weirdness, or at least why I was so quickly outed. It was under the natty lights and against my oncoming headache-- ensured by the sugary shots and warm keg beer-- in a generic off-campus student housing development, that I felt foreign, as foreign as I'd ever been in any place I've yet to see in the world. 

The drunken PDA's, the ritualization of terrible sex, the drugstore top-40 amplified to the point of detonation-- it's not that I had any moral opposition to these in practice, I'd just put them up there with things like High Mass or the self-valorization of the working class. Things that people referred to doing, but never actually did, or did within a kind of watered down sphere of activity. Such is not the case with frat parties, which are, as I have seen with my own eyes, capital-F uccboi orthodox frat *parties.*  That night, I came to terms with the limits of myself. Clearly I was not as advanced as my sister, who seemed to be getting along just fine. 

At first it was suprising to me, that someone as linguistically competent as I was could come off as so alienating. It was a level of communication I was totally incapable of. A rapidly shifting flow of references, slurs, inside jokes, last year's coachella, at every moment, the mimicry of a gesture I hadn't caught, a new party game that I'd never heard of. The reality of reality television was not my reality. I lived in New York, I hadn't had a TV in years, maybe we watched something nostalgic or intelligent on Netflix, either way, I felt like an alien. Or like someone's parents. Clearly, I was some sort of replicant and not Greek-life material. My sentences were too long, my vocabulary stale. 

*Yo girl,* someone called out, *why you gotta get so deep.*

For the first time, I wondered if I actually didn't possess about as much cultural diversity as the outside of an American Apparel bag. Warsaw, Los Angeles - it didn't matter where I was, I moved seamlessly across a plane of cultural consistency that rarely changed, despite the accelerated turnover of its trends. It was a world populated with appearances, but also by people who were aware of those appearances, and I was used to being surrounded by those who were as socially conscious as they were socially mediated. 

I'd shown up looking sexy enough, though looking back, it was probably in some sort of backwards-looking fashion-forward ensemble that in this context, probably came off as actually backwards. Still, I received attention. It wasn't the kind of attention I could navigate easily. To be at the effect of what I was wearing, rather than for what I was wearing to be at the effect of me, was a strange and disorienting loop. Probably my only surviving grace was a pair of blocky stilletto's-- of the kind that make you look like a Bratz doll from the knees down-- that had been lent to me by one of the more sympathetic girls I'd arrived with. It was never concluded whether or not I was over-dressed or under-dressed, but it was implied that my "taste" could potentially compromise the moral integrity of the group. 

I'd accepted the heels as a community service, but my faux-pas began to stack up quickly. After I'd elected to dance with three different fuccboi's in a row, with no intention of continuing the interaction beyond *Sexy's Got Back*, I knew I'd crossed the line into pariah territory. Somebody called me an uptight whore, and I left to go find the back room, where somebody had to be doing drugs. Getting high would at least put me on some kind of common ground with the plebes, however private the experience.

It should be understood that the basic has nothing to do with intelligence. It isn't a question of being smart or dumb, but how well you operate across a predetermined threshold of engagement. The 22 year old who cut adderall in front of me with the Macy's gift card he'd received during his graduation ceremony should be, by now, well into a very lucrative career. I was partying at one of the highest-ranked medical schools in the country. Fuccboi or basic bitch, everyone there was a doctor.
