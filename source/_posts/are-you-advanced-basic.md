```basic``` is a system of predicate relations in which ```self``` is an enclosing object and ````I```` is a procedural force that can generate instance ````self````.  ```breed``` function symbolically mediates complicity between self-referential objects within the matrix and dominant language models. see ```abstract factory```.

> *Each body wants to exhaust its form-of-life and leave it for dead. Then, it passes on to another. This is how a
body gets thicker, nourished with experience. But it also becomes more supple: it has learned how to get rid of one
figure of the self.* [citation needed]

## Are you advanced ```basic```? It depends how far you're willing to go to get over yourself. 
  ```
  basic
  basic.class {Yoga, light CBT, adderall, moralistic therapeutic deism.}
  ``` 
Every lifestyle choice is a coping strategy, a means to overcome the basic fact that life is just basic--  basic to the extent that it could do without us. The paradox is that there's nothing more ```basic``` than focusing in on the pejorative sense of the term. You're ```basic``` if you're still flagging the ```fuccboi``` you met last night, the ```baby voice```, elective victimhood, conscious capitalism, etc etc in the ongoing taste wars. That's not cultural practice. That's just ```basic``` trolling. 

```basic``` in the vernacular describes a compilation of phobias triggered by anyone who isn’t *being themselves* at all costs. 

```basic.attribute {normalized deviance}```

"Being ourselves" describes all the shit we pile onto our experience, the resigned cynicism that populates our intelligence, the rackets we run as social relationships, all the lies we've earned to tell through a certain kind of participation in culture, the creativity behind our strife, great jobs, etc — basically, whatever hides us from the sense that *we’re living beyond our means, and that what it means is something we'll never live up to.  

```advbasic``` isn’t about degentrifying the personal from consumer infiltration, or pop culture, or whateverdomination-- but it is about a chosen indifference to artifical humanism. See also ```Descarte.``` 

``` Create object 
  cartesian subject  basic.basic  also nuclear.basic``` 
```

```Basic``` as that which over-represents itself: a surplus of identity, a formalized pattern that operates as a security environment against the threat of the ```vulnerable.``` 
```
define: basic if{ chain purses, couples, meaningful tattoos, lace-up boots with zippers, identity politics, coachella, aspirant productivity, virtual militarization, spectator terrorism, kink, social justice startups, critical theory, legacy activism, schizophrenic feminism, #metoo, glamping, the alt-right, marxism, personal development, sonograms of unborn children circulating via facebook posts about your 'natural birth', breakdowns, fake news, diversity -> variety, preferences, finding yourself, finding the one, young creatives, social media crypto, consumer holidays, normativity, non-normativity, permaculture, lit hum, failed minimalism, cops, going out 

```

see also ```existential terrorism```. 

You’re ```advbasic``` when you’re beyond subject/object melodramas, which has only ever been the mediation of being in the world through non-consensual sub/dom relationships. Not just capitalism but the entire framework of perception. In cartesian logic, ```being``` emerges as an attribute of consciousness, rather than the intimacy between knowledge and perception. see also ```realization```.  

In other words, nobody exists in thought — but in ```basic``` terms, we survive there. ```basic``` is an existential programming construct that attempts to circumscribe the self in an intelligent machine logic, so that the only possibilities for being are those already constrained by the most base level of interpretation. What's left is ```identity``` as a *compromise*, the result of an inability to reconcile presence with representation. 

Various semantic glitches ensue, which require the ```social deviance``` patch to run. 

```
define representational.politics 

My body is not an object(I have the right to own myself.)
  $I am who I am. 
  
```

```basic``` is an inheritance model in which ```identity``` is a secure, self-referencing system. With the goal of having the kind of referential stability capable of outliving any humanity, including the one that produced it. ```basic``` defines profiles without users, any personality that seems to be abstracted from any one person. The advanced distinction defines ```advbasic``` as **particularity**, not personality. The only thing personal is property, and, as we all know, property is an attribute of objects. 

```define: advbasic when{ particle physics, uncertainty principle```

advbasic is being with no reason for being, and the only thing that has no reason for being is power.

```advbasic``` isn’t a description logic: we’re not trying to develop the right interpreters, capable of processing the endless compilations of signs passing for culture these days, this would be a complete waste of time. Probably on par with critical theory, or consciousness raising. 

If the ```basic``` could be looked at as encryption - an artificial intelligence modeled after the european enlightenment, which didn’t so much liberate subjects as it did objects - then ```advbasic``` is decryption. It is anti-transcendential because that isn’t how you hack shit. advbasic is high level semantics for fun and profit. A means of figuring out not *what something is, but how it is — and the strategic programming of possibilities from there.
