Are you Advanced Basic? If you answered 'yes' to that question, then probably not. 

The New Native
======


I hosted an internet-based public volunteer computer project employing the BOINC software platform created by the Berkely SETI Research Center with the intention of cross-referencing qualitative data obtained from the dating platform Feeld.

It is possible that we find ourselves, once again and always already, up against the gravitational pull that is the void of identity. <img align="right" width="100" height="100" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28285201/37325423-3e3c8c0c-2664-11e8-9e1f-2bb60c389020.jpg">

The Search for Intelligent Life
======

> The following anthropology is an attempt to advance the basic tendency to assign substantial properties to **beings** in terms of predicates and attributes, i.e., to *define* people as *things*. 

Perhaps a radically negative approach is in order by creating categories of *distinction*: the method of creating of new contexts across the domain of being. 

**What we will designate as *advanced basic* is the capability of operating withing the inescabable realm of basic-ness in a way that withstands any temptation to transcend it.**

Person one: Did you enjoy talking with Taylor? They seem interesting. 
Person two: No, they dress well and went to Oberlin but are very boring. Taylor is an advanced basic.

Girl 2: "Nah, she does basic things because she likes them, not to fit in. She's advanced basic"

A History Without Traditions

Two images call to mind the face of 1999.

One is of Chloe Sevigny, the face of the multitude. 

The other is the face of Seattle. Queue fog machine. In Art Club 2000's iconic photographs, strains of kids languidly occupy a living room setting and from there disappear into the streets of the mall. It is very clear we are somewhere in New York, but also somewhere else. Perhaps somewhere close to the vaccuum left in the wake of the systematic smashing of a Starbucks window during the 1999 GTO protests. 

Is this the effect of the Millenium Bug?

Two definitions, One distinction.
=====

*"Whoever said," the scientist Lina demands of her humanist friend, "that a life has to have meaning?*

Because every lifestyle choice is a coping strategy, a means to overcome the basic fact that life is just basic -- and basic to the extent that it could do without us. It's a story that has as much to do with the legacy of the nineteenth century as it does with the contradictions of the twentieth. 

```
The Neapolitan novels were published in English at around the same time the use of the term *basic* entered the American vernacular, between 2011 and 2014. The serial follows the lives of two women born in provincial Italy, and who come of age against the political upheavals of 1968. The main character, Elena, is a "smart girl" who manages to escape her conditions by means of a university education-- only to return to her place of birth unable to speak the dialect under which she was born. The other woman, Lina, remains in Naples, a city she will never leave until she disappears into it. Lina works in a sausage factory and is subject to the most basic of domestic abuse, until she becomes a computer programmer thanks to an IBM correspondence course. Both women must emerge in relation to their role as second-class citizens, the basic circumstances of which they will never escape.

Alvin Gouldner tracks the historical evolution of such an international cultural elite. His 1979 tractatus *The Future of Intellectuals and the Rise of the The New Class* describes a rising demographic that seeks to delegitimize an older, traditional class by means of strategic leverage over the status-quo. You're in the New Class if you've been inculcated with the historical consciousness of the European Left, possess more (or more specialized) technical abilities than the generation prior to you, or can claim a certain amount of cultural capital that always seems to be inversely proportionate to the amount of money you make. This is an exclusively post-war phenomenon, a product of both the social upheavals of the civil rights era and the university-industrial complex. 
```

After Gouldner managed to nail a cultural bourgeosie whose motivations were neither entirely altruistic nor entirely economic, what arose was the story of those, instead, who sought meaning from their position within the emerging world socio-economic order. It's a world populated by those trying to escape tradition, only to find themselves subject to the trappings of history. 

We find ourselves caught somewhere between ideology and technology; we are the becoming of a new, dialectical opposition.

A View From the Periphery to the Mob
======

We could map out a demographic plane of consistency that lacks the claim to any one form of cultural distinction. *The spectre of the majority.*

<img align="right" width="100" height="100" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28285201/37327700-bf15623c-266d-11e8-9c93-557da69467da.jpg">

Basic is a regulatory procedure that sets the parameters for divergence. This is why basic is iterated most deeply in its alternatives - feminists, underdogs, queers, outliers. The Whatever freshness of singularity and youth. 

There's nothing more basic than being yourself, which is a process of gentrification that begins in adolescence and ends only when you're no longer a consumable. Rapid prototyping is the new existentialism.

I began by asking people on Feeld if they resemble their profiles. Why doesn't anyone find this as funny as I do? 

As a pickup line this has not proved very workable - I guess people think I'm asking whether or not their photos are real? 

Anyway this line of thought is also amusing, at least to me.

Stephanie Castaneda
DOB: 9/12/1986
Hair: Brown
Eyes: Brown
Height: 5'4

```

The photograph on the card is a bleach-stained image of a woman of uncertain origin, uncertain character. Hair of an uncertain brown. Her eyebrows are plucked then like the stress-marks above vowel, pronunciation marks. 

Before I was of age I used Stephanie Castaneda as an alias to get into bars. Of course, having to slouch slightly as to better conform my 5'7 to a strangers 5'4. 

Since when do we resemble our representations, isn't it supposed to be the other way around, don't just memorize the day and month on your fake ID - a smart doorman will ask your zodiac sign. 


On the Necessity of Shallow Abstract Categories

aspirant productivity
virtual militarization
spectator terrorism

Public policy measures visibility. Not just facial recognition (racial recognition) but a catalogue measure of faces and spaces, organized in the cultural imagination as a means to divide and ensemble. 

Therefore our strategy is to look as distinct as one appears anonymous.

I chose the user Ines, for inessential. There's nothing personal about this, but then again, it's a *personals* ad. 

>>Case Study: Lana Del Rey. [Her claim to fame being that she found someone else to do it.](https://thenewinquiry.com/the-fake-as-more/)

Ines finds it necessary to retain an element of the undiscovered.
