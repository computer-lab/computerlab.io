## Are you advanced basic? 

If you answered “yes” to that question, then probably not. If the basic can be construed as an ever-adapting, yet never evolving, status quo unconscious of itself as such, any attempt at cultural resistance is futile. You’re advanced basic if you can operate within this realm in a way that withstands any temptation to transcend it— and, at the same time, refuse to surrender to the logic of its conformity. 

The definition of the advanced basic, via Urban Dictionary, describes “someone who has the appearance and knowledge of someone deeply involved with culture, but who has the basic attitude.” The second definition, slightly less popular, appears at first as a direct contradiction: “someone who acts very basic, but *does not have the basic attitude.* 

Advanced basic is a semantic paradigm, rather than just another identitarian trend. It's here that we can avoid the danger of over-simplification. Is the concept of advanced basic an attempt to reclaim/re-appropriate the basic, territorially motivated, like any other form of identity politics? Or can our engagement with the language point towards a way out, a means by which to *politicize* identity?

Advanced basic describes a modality of self-expression that arises out of an active engagement with normative behavior, a means of dislocating identity beyond both any singular mode of participation or fixed representation of self. In this sense, the emergence of the advanced basic might have more in common with the biblical treatise of being “in the world, yet not of it” than it does with any historical avant-garde. 

The late sociologist Alvin Gouldner was of the first to articulate the emergent notion of the "New Class." In *The Future of Intellectuals and the Rise of the New Class,* Gouldner tracks the historical evolution of the cultural elite as a rising class that seeks to delegitimize an older, traditional class through a strategic leveraging of the status-quo. This is a post-war phenomenon, a product of both the social upheavals of the civil rights era and the university-industrial complex. 
And though his thesis applies directly to those of the boomer generation that managed to avoid-- for men-- the draft-- and for women-- secondary status as housewives, the concept hasn't lost its relevance for those trying to figure out what the hell is going on today. You're in the New Class if you've been inculcated with the historical consciousness of the European Left, possess more (or more specialized) technical abilities than the generation prior to you, or can claim a certain amount of cultural capital that always seems to be inversely proportionate to the amount of money you make. 

The New Class has always sought to align itself with a so-called universal class-- a middle class-- in order to safeguard its legitimacy. But the middle class has never existed as such, and neither has the basic. Yes, the "middle class" can be located on an economic spectrum just as the "basic" can be located on a cultural one, but neither can be determined by any objective measure of income or fixed locus of signification. (Noting here, that Starbucks was once an advanced cultural specimen, that then became a basic brand strategy, for those of the middle-class who wanted to be a little bit more up and coming, a little bit more eco-conscious.) What I'm trying to point out, in relation to the idea of the basic and the possibilities of cultural advancement, is the existence of a referential void, something like a "silent majority," that never seems to exist by itself or for itself, but always in relation to those driven by an ethical intensity, and a desire to find themselves *on the right side of history*-- regardless of what side that may be. 

Gouldner managed to nail a cultural bourgeosie whose motivations were neither entirely altruistic nor entirely economic, but who instead sought to find *meaning* in their position within the emerging world socio-economic order. This was evidenced in 2011, when a relatively small percentage of over-educated, under-employed millenials managed to pass off their agenda as the interest of 99% of the population. However, those "with the appearance and knowledge of someone deeply involved with culture, but who have the basic attitude" could easily fit the profile of the modern vanguard party, from Lenin to the Situationists. The stakes of the vanguard have always been inextricable from *"that class of civil society that is not a class of civil society, the class that is the dissolution of all classes, the sector of society that has the character of the general because it's suffering is general,"* etc., etc. -- or in other words, the *basic*.

Though I hardly qualify as basic, I'm not sure if I meet the standards for advanced, either. Case in point: in 2015, I found myself at a frat party. I'd never been to one before. I was 25, and hadn't spent much time in college, at least formally-- by that time my circulation within certain elite academic milieu's forfeited any purpose, or taste I had left, for the task. Up until that point I'd thought of myself as a worldly person, as someone who knew how to party, and could do so just about anywhere. I'd recently returned from a modeling tour across Europe. It was a three-month slew of gigs and nightclubs, so I was well acquainted with the practice of knowing my limits and looking like I belonged wherever it was that I was. But this was my first time in middle America. I was two, maybe three jello shots in, which had been served to me without the usual chaser of irony. That might have explained the weirdness. 

Despite my awareness, I possessed about as much cultural diversity as the outside of an American Apparel bag. Warsaw, Los Angeles - it didn't matter where I was, I moved seamlessly across a plane of cultural consistency that rarely changed, despite the accelerated turnover of its trends. It was a world populated with appearances, but also by people who were aware of those appearances, and I was used to being surrounded by those who were as socially conscious as they were socially mediated. 

I'd shown up to this party looking sexy enough, to be sure I received attention-- but it wasn't a look I was used to. To be at the effect of what I was wearing, rather than for what I was wearing to be at the effect of me, had a strange and disorienting affect. I had on the kind of blocky stilletto heels that elevate the toe to reduce the slope of the heel-- the kind you see at those seedy off-brand boutiques in the Financial District, or at a Rainbow-- that enable one to walk miles in 3.5 inches, but that also come off as making whoever's wearing them look like a Bratz doll. The heels had been lent to me by one of the more sympathetic girls of the group I'd come with. My outfit was probably some standard-fare LBD or the sartorial equivalent of "that which seamlessly rides the line between sexy and professional," depending on the height of the heels or the size of the bag, and of course, my mood at a certain point in the evening. It was never concluded whether or not I was over-dressed or under-dressed for this occasion. It was implied that my "taste" could potentially compromise the moral integrity of the group, so I accepted the heels, and didn't necessarily mind slutting it up in the service of the community. 

Natty light, warm keg beer, drunken PDA’s, the ritualization of terrible sex— it's not that I had any moral opposition to these practices, I'd just put them up there with things like Scientology or Freemasonry or workers self-valorization-- things that people referred to doing, but never actually did. But here it was, and the world that appeared before me had never been so foreign. I was deep in the throes of the basic, and my skills were clearly not as advanced as those of my sister, who seemed to be getting along just fine. 

At first it was suprising to me, that someone as linguistically competent as I was could come across as so alienating. I found myself incapable of small-talk, or at least the kind of small-talk that circulated here. A rapidly shifting flow of references, slurs, inside jokes, last year's coachella, at every moment, a new party game that I'd never heard of, the mimicry of a gesture I hadn't caught. The reality of reality television. I lived in New York, I hadn't had a TV in years, maybe we watched something nostalgic or intelligent on Netflix, either way, I felt like an alien. Or someone's parents. Either way, my faux-pas began to stack up quickly. Clearly, I was some sort of replicant and not Greek-life material. My sentences were too long, my vocabulary stale. *Yo girl,* someone called out, *why you gotta get so deep.*

After I'd elected to dance with three different fuccboi's in a row, with no intention of continuing the interaction beyond *Sexy's Got Back*, I knew I'd crossed the line into pariah territory. Somebody called me an uptight whore, and I left to go find the back room, where somebody had to be doing drugs. Getting high would at least put me on some kind of common ground with the plebes, however private the experience.

It should be understood that the basic has nothing to do with intelligence. It isn't a question of being smart or dumb, but how well you operate on a certain threshold of engagement. The 22 year old who cut adderall in front of me with the Macy's gift card he'd received during the graduation ceremony should be, by now, well into a very lucrative career. I was partying at one of the highest-ranked medical schools in the country. The people around me were doctors. 




If it weren't for the internet, it's unlikely I'd have been socialized at all.
