## Are you advanced basic? 

If you answered “yes” to that question, then probably not. If the basic can be construed as an ever-adapting, yet never evolving, status quo unconscious of itself as such, any attempt at cultural resistance is futile. You’re advanced basic if you can operate within this realm in a way that withstands any temptation to transcend it— and, at the same time, refuse to surrender to the logic of its conformity. 

The definition of the advanced basic, via Urban Dictionary, describes “someone who has the appearance and knowledge of someone deeply involved with culture, but who has the basic attitude.” The second definition, slightly less popular, appears at first as a direct contradiction: “someone who acts very basic, but *does not have the basic attitude.* 

A parsing through of crowdsourced contradictions will elucidate the advanced basic as a semantic paradigm, rather than just another identitarian trend. It's here that we can avoid the danger of over-simplification. Is the concept of advanced basic an attempt to reclaim/re-appropriate the basic, territorially motivated, like any other form of identity politics? Or can our engagement with the language point towards a way out, a means by which to *politicize* identity?

In this sense, the emergence of the advanced basic might have more in common with the biblical concept of being “in the world, yet not of it” than it does with any historical avant-garde. 

The late sociologist Alvin Gouldner was of the first to articulate the emergent notion of the "New Class." In *The Future of Intellectuals and the Rise of the New Class,* Gouldner tracks the historical evolution of the cultural elite as a rising class that seeks to delegitimize an older, tr
