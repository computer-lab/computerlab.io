Are you advanced basic? If you answered “yes” to that question, then probably not. If the basic can be construed as an ever-adapting, yet never evolving, status quo unconscious of itself as such, any attempt at cultural resistance is futile. You’re advanced basic if you can operate within this realm in a way that withstands any temptation to transcend it— and, at the same time, refuse to surrender to the logic of its conformity. 

The definition of the advanced basic, via Urban Dictionary, describes “someone who has the appearance and knowledge of someone deeply involved with culture, but who has the basic attitude.” The second definition, slightly less popular, appears at first as a direct contradiction: “someone who acts very basic, but *does not have the basic attitude.* 

A parsing through of crowdsourced contradictions will elucidate the advanced basic as a semantic paradigm, rather than just another identitarian trend. It's here that we can avoid the danger of over-simplification. Is the concept of advanced basic an attempt to reclaim/re-appropriate the basic, territorially motivated, like any other form of identity politics? Or can our engagement with the language point towards a way out, a means by which to *politicize* identity?

Advanced basic describes a modality of self-expression that arises out of an active engagement with normative behavior, a means of dislocating ones individuality beyond both any fixed form of representation or singular mode of participation. In this sense, the emergence of the advanced basic might have more in common with the biblical concept of being “in the world, yet not of it” than it does with any historical avant-garde.
