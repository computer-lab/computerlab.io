I hope that today is the beginning of a process where Computer Lab works to
improve the quality of the Pigeon Sounds HD app with help from pigeon lovers all
over the world.

Every day I discover [new pigeon sounds](https://instagram.com/p/BfI8ZbGh4Bu/)
and I hope to capture them all in this app.

Please send us pigeon sound clips along with information about the context in
which the sound was recorded. It would be great if the app included many
different variations of each type of sound, along with information about the
bird(s) that made it.

In the process of submitting the app to Google Play, I noticed that there are
already [many Android pigeon sound
apps](https://play.google.com/store/search?q=Pigeon%20Sounds%20HD&c=apps). These
apps have great features including integration with messaging apps (so you can
send pigeon sounds to friends) and integration with the OS's notification and
alarm system. I'm constantly inspired and humbled by the amount of software out
there!

Thank you to [Daniel Brewster](http://www.danielbrewster.com/) for responding to
an inquiry on the Computer Lab Runoff [mailing
list](https://confirmsubscription.com/h/j/53E8DEBA95C07A35) and quickly
developing the code for this app.
