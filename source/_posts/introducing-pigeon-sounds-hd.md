I hope that today's release will be the beginning of a journey where Computer
Lab works to improve the quality of this app with help from pigeon lovers all
over the world.

Every day I discover new pigeon sounds and behavior and I hope to capture them all
in this app.

Please feel free to send pigeon sound clips along with information about the
context in which the sound was recorded. It would be great if the app included
many different variations of each type of sound, along with information about
the bird(s) that made it.

In the process of submitting the Android app to the play store, I noticed that
there are already [many Android pigeon sound apps](https://play.google.com/store/search?q=Pigeon%20Sounds%20HD&c=apps). These
app have great features including integration with messaging apps (so you can
send pigeon sounds to friends) and integration with the OS's notification and
alarm system. There is truly and inspiring and humbling amount of software out
there!

Thank you to [Daniel Brewster](http://www.danielbrewster.com/) for responding to
an inquiry on the Computer Lab Runoff [mailing
list](https://confirmsubscription.com/h/j/53E8DEBA95C07A35) and quickly
developing the code for this app.
