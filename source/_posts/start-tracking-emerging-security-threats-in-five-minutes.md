__Learn how to monitor security feeds to stay ahead of the ongoing threats to your infrastructure.__

### Background

How do you become aware of security bugs in your software systems? Is it when
a machine prompts you to install updates? Is it when you read about them on
Hacker News? Is it when you get owned?

Creating an automated patch management system is a great way to stay secure.
However, depending on your threat model, you might need to do even better than
that. It may not be acceptable to wait for your patch management system to apply
an update on a schedule or to wait for a patch in a library to propagate upstream.

By keeping track of security vulnerabilities on your own, you can catch potential
weaknesses in your infrastructure without delay. Software vendors and special
interest groups have created a number of security feeds that make it easy to stay
abreast of the latest security bugs. In this article, we present a directory of
the feeds that I follow at Computer Lab when managing critical systems.

*If you want a quick TL;DR click [here](#TL-DR)*

### General Vulnerabilities

These comprehensive feeds report vulnerabilities in software across operating systems.
Monitoring these lists can help you catch bugs in your stack and provide a
platform for the general discussion of software security.

#### [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/)

**Message Frequency** Daily  
**Formats** Raw Data, Twitter, Web

The CVE standard defines a universal format for describing vulnerabilities in
software and systems. MITRE maintains both the CVE standard and a large database of assigned
CVE identifiers. The CVE system has inspired other standards for [scoring](https://www.first.org/cvss)
and [reporting](http://www.icasi.org/cvrf) vulnerabilities. The federal government
provides a convenient interface for searching and visualizing CVEs at the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/).

#### [United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT)](https://www.us-cert.gov/mailing-lists-and-feeds)

**Message Frequency** Varies  
**Formats** Mailing List, RSS

US-CERT is a division of the federal government that tracks cyber threats.
They have a variety of feeds for both high and low frequency security bulletins.
They also publish advisories that are not specific to a particular piece
of software but rather describe best practices and current trends in computer
security.

#### [Bugtraq](http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/description#0.3.1)

**Message Frequency** Daily  
**Formats** Mailing List

Despite being one of the oldest security mailing lists, you can still find
advisories posted to Bugtraq today. Bugtraq is not just an announce list - you
can engage in conversation with other security professionals.

#### [OSS Security](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/)

**Message Frequency** Daily  
**Formats** Mailing List

OSS Security is a common place for new vulnerabilities to be posted, often
cross posted to Bugtraq and Full Disclosure. Like Bugtraq, there will
occasionally be more general discussion of security practices. Until recently,
CVEs were assigned here.

#### [Full Disclosure (FD)](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/fulldisclosure)

**Message Frequency** Daily  
**Formats** Mailing List

FD is old-school mailing list named for the security reporting principle of
[Full Disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_disclosure_%28computer_security%29).
The list has much less activity than OSS Security or Bugtraq but it can still be
a valuable source of news, discussions & vulnerabilities.

### Linux Vulnerabilities

Most Linux distributions have a public security mailing list where security
updates are announced. I have only included the more popular server distributions
here but it should be easy to find a similar list for any distribution.

#### [Red Hat Security Announce](https://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/rhsa-announce)

**Message Frequency** Varies  
**Formats** Mailing List

Security announcements for all Red Hat products and services.

#### [Ubuntu Security Announce](https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-security-announce)

**Message Frequency** Varies  
**Formats** Mailing List

Security updates for all flavors of Ubuntu.

### Windows Vulnerabilities

Despite Microsoft's low reputation within the security community, they do offer
many valuable resources for security professionals.

#### [Microsoft Security Notification Service](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/dd252948.aspx)

**Message Frequency** Monthly  
**Formats** Mailing List

These notifications provide a low-frequency, high-level overview of patched vulnerabilities
in Microsoft products.

#### [Microsoft Security Advisories](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/dd252948.aspx)

**Message Frequency** Varies  
**Formats** RSS

Advisories that report low-impact vulnerabilities or security-related updates
are sent here.

#### [Microsoft Security Updates](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/bulletins.aspx)

**Message Frequency** Monthly  
**Formats** Web

On [Patch Tuesday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_Tuesday), Microsoft releases
information about patched vulnerabilities on its website. The bulletins are quite
detailed, indicating the affected versions of any relevant software, mitigating
factors, workarounds & occasionally attribution to the original reporter.

### Bonus: Amazon Web Services

I imagine that most readers are using AWS for some, if not all, of their infrastructure.
Here are some resources to help you stay on top of vulnerabilities in the cloud.

#### [Amazon Linux AMI Security](https://alas.aws.amazon.com/)

**Message Frequency** Varies  
**Formats** RSS, Web

Notifications of vulnerabilities in Amazon's flavor of Red Hat (Amazon Linux).

#### [Amazon Security Bulletins](https://aws.amazon.com/security/security-bulletins/)

**Message Frequency** Varies  
**Formats** RSS, Web

Security bulletins for vulnerabilities in Amazon services (e.g: RDS) and
internal software (e.g: Xen). Also includes general security notices for critical
vulnerabilities Ã  la CERT.

### TL;DR

If you're a practicing software engineer but not a security professional,
following [US-CERT](#United-States-Computer-Emergency-Readiness-Team-US-CERT)
should be more than enough to get a feel for how emerging threats might impact your work.

If you want detailed updates for a particular operating system you
should subscribe to their security announce list. If you want to catch vulnerabilities
in the software & libraries that make up your stack, you should subscribe to
[Bugtraq](#Bugtraq), [Full Disclosure](#Full-Disclosure-FD) and [OSS Security](#OSS-Security).

To identify potential vulnerabilities even faster, you can follow the issue trackers
for any relevant pieces of software and watch for security-related bugs. You
should note, however, that frequently security issues are reported out-of-band
on a private channel to prevent exploitation.
