The lab offers a number of services to increase our productivity. 

Here's a list with information about how to access them.

## Slack

Slack is a chat service useful for discussing projects in detail.
The lab slack url is https://computer-lab.slack.com.

Each general user costs $8/month.  General users can access
all channels.

We can add people to a single channel for free, though.  This is
useful for clients or people who want to chat.

## Harvest

Harvest is a time tracking service that can also be used to
generate invoices and estimates.

The harvest url is https://computerlab.harvestapp.com.  

With the current plan, each additional user costs $10/month and
we can create unlimited clients/projects.

## Github

The github url is https://github.com/computer-lab.  We don't have
any private repositories.
