"Nothing propagates itself through the Crypt without realizing
the operational identity of culture and machinery,
effectively dismantling the organic body into numerizing
particles which swarm in dislocated swirls. Crypt-entities
are both hyper-vortical singularities and units of Digital

of numerical fictions that make themselves real,

or productive involvement that function consistently

or meaning. Instead, they coincide with the hype-spirals.
Cyberhype - that flattens signs and resources onto nonsignifying
triggers, diagrams, and assembly jargons."

Particles.js is a lightweight, dependency-free, and responsive library of virtual particles-- just like your virtual currency. 
Or more like how you'd like to imagine your virtual currency, you know, as an investor with little more than a cursory knowledge of how 
the blockchain actually works. To say nothing of political economics. 

Developed as a plug-in for the addition of particle backgrounds to websites, particles.js is a Javascript library for the 
creation of virtual fragments that interact with themselves or with a user, with seemingly endless options 
for configuration. One might imagine the tool as having implications for data visualization or experimental UI/UXD, 
but it's much more elementary than that- at least in its present usage. After all, there's nothing more 
elementary than a bunch of particles. The background points to a tendency to brand FinTech projects as having the dynamic of a 
social network. It re-imagines virtual capital as a system of nodes and connective branches, always in movement, with the ability
to shift forms and reconfigure-- but without the capacity to inflate or burst. 
In other words, the blockchain is a cloud, not a bubble. 

It doesn't take a cryptographer to point out the inconsistencies in popular terminology. Cryptocurrency isn't just digital 
currency, it's virtual currency. Finance has been digitized for a long time, with the technology of the stock ticker being a 
sort of proto-digital technology. This comes to a peak in the 1970's, with financial deregulation. In 1972, with the breaking of the 
Bretton-Woods agreements, Richard Nixon stated that the dollar would essentially have no reference to any economic referent, 
but that value would henceforth be determined by an act of language. It was the beginning of the financialization of the economy,
as well as the credit system - both of which depended on the innovation of digital technology. The virtualization of currency is
an extension of this model, and can be distinguished not only by the sophistication and development of cryptography, but by 
the aesthetic paradigms - the interface metaphors - that determine the logic of its exchange. Digitization is a modality of translation.
Virtualization is a modality of representation. Currency systems operate within both realms. Money transfers value, it also represents it. 

What's interesting about particles.js isn't the mechanics of the plugin itself, but how it operates more like a meme than any 
kind of structural metaphor for virtual currency. It's appearance on platforms such as Debitum Network, INS.world etc etc [add more examples, 
note on obsolecence of trend] But what was with the ubiquity of particles.js on emergent blockchain projects? Since the
development of Ethereum, some worried that too many alt coin models could dilute the market, and compromise the potential of de-centralized 
economic models at large.[[link: http://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/the-coming-demise-of-altcoins/]] 
A kind of bit-Babylon, after the tower of financial capital has collapsed. On a surface level, it answers the question everybody seems to be asking: What makes your altcoin so special? 
Nothing, and that’s precisely why it’s sustainable. Any economic system that lacks a material economic referent - such as gold - must 
rely on standardization, and in virtual finance, that standard is a system of protocols. Particles.js is both brand identity and interface
metaphor, ideal for a time when the words "full-stack developer" is equivalent with the term "new money." 



metaformalism
overcoded virtual surplus 
template criteria 
totally neuronic

prevailing signaletics and information-science are both insufficiently abstract and over-theoretical- 
They cannot see the machine for the apparatus, or the singularity for the model.
