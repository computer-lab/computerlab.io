## "Nothing propagates itself through the Crypt without realizing
the operational identity of culture and machinery,
effectively dismantling the organic body into numerizing
particles which swarm in dislocated swirls. Crypt-entities
are both hyper-vortical singularities and units of Digital

of numerical fictions that make themselves real,

or productive involvement that function consistently
with the flatline. Crypt-cultures know nothing of work
or meaning. Instead, they coincide with the hype-spirals.
Cyberhype - that flattens signs and resources onto nonsignifying
triggers, diagrams, and assembly jargons."


Particles.js is a lightweight, dependency-free, and responsive library of virtual particles-- just like your currency. 

Developed as a plug-in for the addition of particle backgrounds to websites, particles.js is a Javascript library
for the creation of virtual fragments that interact with themselves or with a user, with seemingly endless options 
for configuration. One might imagine the tool as having implications for data visualization or 
experimental UI/UXD, but it's much more elementary than that- at least in its present usage. After all, there's nothing more 
elementary than a bunch of particles.

What’s with the ubiquity of particles.js on emergent blockchain projects? Since the
development of Ethereum- a blockchain enterprise that enables nearly anyone to 
create their own cryptocurrency- some have worried that too many alt coin models 
could dilute the market, andcompromise the potential of de-centralized economic models at large. 
A kind of bit-Babylon, after the tower of financial capital has collapsed. 
Particles.js operates more like a meme than any kind of organizational strategy, yet speaks to both 
the standardization and secularization of digital currencies. What makes your altcoin so special? Nothing, and that’s precisely why it’s valuable.

totally neuronic

prevailing signaletics and information-science are both insufficiently abstract and over-theoretical- 
They cannot see the machine for the apparatus, or the singularity for the model.
