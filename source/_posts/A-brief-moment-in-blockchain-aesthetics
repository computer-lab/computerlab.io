## "Nothing propagates itself through the Crypt without realizing
the operational identity of culture and machinery,
effectively dismantling the organic body into numerizing
particles which swarm in dislocated swirls. Crypt-entities
are both hyper-vortical singularities and units of Digital
Hyperstition - or brands of the outside - real components
of numerical fictions that make themselves real,

or productive involvement that function consistently
with the flatline. Crypt-cultures know nothing of work
or meaning. Instead, they coincide with the hype-spirals.
Cyberhype - that flattens signs and resources onto nonsignifying
triggers, diagrams, and assembly jargons."


Particles.js is a lightweight, dependency-free, and responsive library of virtual particles-- just like your currency. 

Developed as a plug-in for the addition of particle backgrounds to websites, particles.js is a Javascript library
for the creation of virtual fragments that interact with themselves or with a user, with seemingly endless options 
for configuration. One might imagine the tool as having implications for data visualization or 
experimental UI/UXD, but it's much more elementary than that- at least in its present usage. After all, there's nothing more 
elementary than a bunch of particles 

metaformalism
overcoded virtual surplus 
template criteria 
totally neuronic

prevailing signaletics and information-science are both insufficiently abstract and over-theoretical- 
They cannot see the machine for the apparatus, or the singularity for the model.
