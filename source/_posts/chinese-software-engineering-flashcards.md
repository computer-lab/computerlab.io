Are you a software engineer whose work involves communicating in Chinese with your colleagues or clients? Or are you an English speaker who wants to learn the accurate jargon to maneuver within Chinese product development and marketplaces? Computer Lab’s [Chinese Software Engineering and Product Management Terminology](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1351796314) Anki Deck offers a unique and streamlined resource directly catered to these needs.

Our flashcards include over 350 terms and phrases commonly used in software engineering and product management, such as “smoke test” (冒烟测试), “side effect” (副作用), “replicate a problem” (重现问题), and “equally consider” (兼顾).
