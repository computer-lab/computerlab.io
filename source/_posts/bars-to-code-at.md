__Why bars are a better place to code than coffee shops.__

First, bars are essentially hardwood standing desks. The surfaces at bars tend
to be more flat and steady. I hate the feeling of trying to code at a wobbly
little cafe table.

Bars tend to have more power outlets. Many recently-opened bars have
power strips running under the bar or along seating areas. I think this is
because bars want people to linger, and coffee shops don't. Someone staying at a
bar for a few hours will likely order a number of expensive drinks, where
someone staying at a cafe will only order a coffee and maybe a snack.

Bars tend to be darker and cooler, relative to cafes, which are often
stuffy and sunny.

Finally, after a good coding session, I often find myself in a sort of distant,
aphasic state. Everything seems flat and it's hard to think of anything to say.
Being at a bar gives me a chance to turn off my computer, find someone to talk
with, and reintegrate.

Of course, not all bars are good places to code. Some bars are problematic for
social reasons, and others are problematic for practical reasons. Here's a list
of bars that Computer Lab members have found suitable for computer use.


### [Skytown](http://www.skytownbk.com/)
[Bushwick](https://goo.gl/maps/SwAZJAFYTwR2)

Skytown is my personal favorite on this list, probably for nostalgic reasons. It
was the first bar that I coded at. In my time there, I've never found the place
unpleasantly loud or crowded, and the music is usually good enough that I'm able
to forego use of my [Bose QuietComfort 35 Noise Cancelling
Headphones](https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Wireless-Headphones-Cancelling/dp/B01E3SNO1G).

Skytown serves cheap and excellent bean tacos until 2:00AM, which is great for
people who like to [start coding at
11PM](https://twitter.com/mannynotfound/status/862147137769005056). There's
power outlets under the bar (sometimes you have to ask the bartenders to plug in
the strip), and stable wifi. Finally, I've met a wide range of interesting
people there, including a recruiter from the Fed who attempted to whiteboard me
on the spot.

### [61 Local](http://61local.com/)
[Cobble Hill](https://goo.gl/maps/4VdkZB9xAcv)

Each month, a room upstairs at 61 Local hosts the exclusive [BrooklynJS
meetup](http://brooklynjs.com/). If you can't get a ticket to the event, the bar
is still a good place to catch a glimpse of a local JavaScript celebrity like
Jenn Schiffer or Steve Klabnik. The place has an airy atmosphere with good
lighting and acoustics, and the food menu is extensive. But 61 Local opens early, so
outlets can be hard to find, and closes around midnight (relatively early).

### [Sugarburg](http://www.sugarburg.com/)
[Williamsburg](https://goo.gl/maps/A2iQNHNmyTs)

Sugarburg features great natural light, unconventional seating, above-par bar
food, and good service. The vertically slatted windows allow you to enjoy the
weather outside without suffering from it.

The bartenders encourage people to use the bar as a workspace during the day,
making Sugarburg a good place to work or meet regularly. The bar is large and
Bourbon-oriented, so Sugarburg is also a great place to hang out late into the
night.

### [Boobie Trap](http://www.boobietrapbrooklyn.com/)
[Bushwick](https://goo.gl/maps/Q3CUv7sTRVE2)

[Robert Jensen](http://you.could.use.some.r1b.solutions/) says that Boobie Trap
is actually a pretty horrible place to code (it's very loud and the tables are
sticky), but it's one of the few places along the L in Bushwick with good
internet. There's also a dedicated charging station for phones and a power
strip. Rob goes to Boobie Trap to push docker containers and backups.


### [Mother's](http://mothersbrooklyn.com/)
[Williamsburg](https://goo.gl/maps/So1UNBjJpio)

According to [Kelsey Hunter](https://twitter.com/kelsey_ah), the ideal Mother's
coding session starts with a burger and fries, is broken up with a lemonade, and
ends with a draft beer.  Mother's also has a lot of outlets, ok wifi, and a
backyard for phone calls. The $12 lunch special lasts until 5PM.  They have TVs
with movies so you have something to look at while absorbing the sound of social
interactions.

### [The Roof](https://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/service/roof-taproom-dining)
[Gowanus](https://goo.gl/maps/SwRfPpz7AbC2)

The Roof is the bar on the roof of the Gowanus Whole Foods, a favorite coding
spot of influential Twitter user [Sbarro
Chica](https://twitter.com/SbarroChica). In the summer, the breezy outdoor
seating area is a great place to work while enjoying a flight of craft beer and
a view of Manhattan.

If the bar food isn't to your liking, you can go downstairs and select from the
many juices, meats, and breads of the Whole Foods Market. The only real downside
of the location is that Whole Foods wifi periodically kicks users off the
network, but the good news is that you can quickly sign on again by simply
clicking a button.

### [Flowers For All Occasions](http://www.flowersforalloccasions.org/)
[Bedford-Stuyvesant](https://goo.gl/maps/2KfMCU1C95x)

Flowers For All Occasions doesn't serve liquor, which can be a feature if you're
looking for a place without a lot of very drunk people.  The vibe tends to
reflect the place's name: it's a pleasant place for conversation, quiet group
activities, or thoughtful work. I was introduced to Flowers For All Occasions by
former Computer Lab Writer in Residence [Theo
Thimo](https://twitter.com/theoooeooo), who often uses it as a place to read and
write. I enjoyed the simple veggie burger and wine selection.

### [Rebecca's](https://www.facebook.com/rebeccasbushwick/)
[Bushwick](https://goo.gl/maps/QtoNcJh9ky52)

Rebecca's is r1b's favorite bar in Bushwick. During the day it is a chill place
to sit on the couch and get lost in your computer. At night it comes alive with
DJ / VJ sets and a unique lighting system. r1b can often be found here staring
at his phone and imbibing $5 beer / shot combos at the end of a long day. Wifi
is available and there is plenty of seating at the bar, tables and couches.

### [Brooklyn Kava](http://www.brooklynkava.com/)
[Bushwick](https://goo.gl/maps/g3qLjPmbcT72)

Brooklyn Kava is not your typical bar - they serve psychoactive root beverages
in lieu of booze. If you haven't had the chance to try kava or kratom I highly
recommend Brooklyn Kava for your first experience. Regardless, the space is an
excellent place to get work done. It is typically quiet & calm with lots of
seating at the sturdy bar. The wifi is excellent and the staff are friendly.
