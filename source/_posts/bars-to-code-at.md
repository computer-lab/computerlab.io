__In my opinion, bars are better places to code than coffee shops.__

First, bars are essentially hardwood standing desks. In general, the surfaces in
bars tend to be flat and steady. I hate the feeling of trying to code at a
wobbly little cafe table.

Second, bars tend to have more power outlets. Most recently-opened bars have
power strips running under the bar or along seating areas. I think this is
because bars want people to linger, and coffee shops don't. Someone staying at a
bar for a few hours will likely order a number of expensive drinks, whereas
someone staying at a cafe will only order a coffee and maybe a snack.

Third, bars tend to be darker and cooler, relative to cafes, which are often
stuffy and sunny.

Finally, after a good coding session, I often find myself in a sort of distant,
aphasic state. Everything seems flat and it's hard to think of anything to say.
Being at a bar gives me a chance to turn off my computer, find someone to talk
to, and reintegrate into irl.

Of course, not all bars are good places to code: some bars don't work because of
social factors, and others don't work for more practical reasons. Here's a list
of bars that Computer Lab members have found suitable for productive computer
use.

### Mother's

According to Kelsey Hunter, the ideal Mother's coding session starts with a
burger and fries, is broken up with a lemonade, and ends with a draft beer.
Mother's also has a lot of outlets, ok wifi, and a backyard for phone calls. The
$12 lunch special lasts until 5PM.  They have TVs with movies so you have
something to look at while sitting alone absorbing the sound of other's social
interactions.

### Skytown

Skytown is my personal favorite on this list, probably due to years of nostalgic
coding and drinking memories. In my time there, I've never found the place
unpleasantly loud or crowded, and the music tends to be interesting enough that I'm often
able to forego use of my [Bose QuietComfort 35 Noise Cancelling
Headphones](https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Wireless-Headphones-Cancelling/dp/B01E3SNO1G).

Skytown serves cheap and excellent bean tacos until 2:00AM, which is great for
people who like to [start coding at
11PM](https://twitter.com/mannynotfound/status/862147137769005056). There's
power outlets under the bar (sometimes you have to ask the bartenders to plug in
the strip), and stable wifi. Finally, I've met a wide range of interesting
people there, including a recruiter from the Fed who attempted to whiteboard me
on the spot.

### Sugarburg

Sugarburg features great lighting, unconventional seating, above-par bar food,
and good service. The vertically slatted windows make this a good place to enjoy
the weather in the summer.The bartenders are friendly to people using the bar as
a workspace during the day, making Sugarburg a good place to work or meet
regularly. The bar is large and Burboun-oriented, making Sugarburg a great place
to hang out late into the night.

### Boobie Trap

[Robert Jensen](http://you.could.use.some.r1b.solutions/) says that Boobie Trap
is actually a pretty horrible place to code (it's very loud and the tables are
sticky), but it's one of the few places along the L in Bushwick with good
internet.  He goes there to push docker containers and backups.

### 61 Local

Each month, a room upstairs at 61 Local hosts the exclusive [BrooklynJS
meetup](http://brooklynjs.com/). If you can't get a ticket to the event, the bar
is still a good place to catch a glimpse of a local JavaScript celebrity like
Jenn Schiffer or Steve Klabnik. The place has a good atmosphere, airy with nice
lighting and acoustics. The menu is varied and extensive. But it opens early, so
seats with outlets can be hard to find, and closes around midnight (relatively
early).

### The Roof

The Roof is the bar on the roof of the Gowanus Whole Foods, and a favorite
coding spot of influential Twitter user [Sbarro
Chica](https://twitter.com/SbarroChica). In the summer, the breezy outdoor
seating area is a great place to work while enjoying a flight of beer and a view
of Manhattan. If the bar food isn't to your liking, you can go downstairs and
select from the many juices, meats, and breads of the Whole Foods Market. The
only real downside of the location is that Whole Foods wifi periodically kicks
users off the network every two hours, but the good news is that you can quickly
sign on again by clicking a button.

### Flowers For All Occasions

Flowers For All Occasions doesn't serve liquor, which can be a feature if you're
trying to find a place without lots of very drunk people.  In general the vibe
of the place tends to reflect its name: it's a pleasant place for conversation,
quiet group activities, or thoughtful work. I was introduced to Flowers For All
Occasions by Computer Lab Writer in Residence Theo Thimo, who often uses it as a
place to read and write. I enjoyed the simple veggie burger and wine selection.

__Please DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ptsteadman) if you think there's
another bar that should be added to this list.__
