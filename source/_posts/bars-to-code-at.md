__Why bars are a better place to code than coffee shops.__

First, bars are essentially hardwood standing desks. In general, the surfaces in
bars tend to be more flat and steady. I hate the feeling of trying to code at a
wobbly little cafe table.

Bars tend to have more power outlets. Most recently-opened bars have
power strips running under the bar or along seating areas. I think this is
because bars want people to linger, and coffee shops don't. Someone staying at a
bar for a few hours will likely order a number of expensive drinks, where
someone staying at a cafe will only order a coffee and maybe a snack.

Bars tend to be darker and cooler, relative to cafes, which are often
stuffy and sunny.

Finally, after a good coding session, I often find myself in a sort of distant,
aphasic state. Everything seems flat and it's hard to think of anything to say.
Being at a bar gives me a chance to turn off my computer, find someone to talk
to, and reintegrate.

Of course, not all bars are good places to code. Some bars are problematic for
social reasons, and others are problematic for practical reasons. Here's a list
of bars that Computer Lab members have found suitable for computer use.


### Skytown

Skytown is my personal favorite on this list, probably for nostalgic reasons. It
was the first bar that I coded at. In my time there, I've never found the place
unpleasantly loud or crowded, and the music tends to be interesting enough that
I'm often able to forego use of my [Bose QuietComfort 35 Noise Cancelling
Headphones](https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Wireless-Headphones-Cancelling/dp/B01E3SNO1G).

Skytown serves cheap and excellent bean tacos until 2:00AM, which is great for
people who like to [start coding at
11PM](https://twitter.com/mannynotfound/status/862147137769005056). There's
power outlets under the bar (sometimes you have to ask the bartenders to plug in
the strip), and stable wifi. Finally, I've met a wide range of interesting
people there, including a recruiter from the Fed who attempted to whiteboard me
on the spot.

### Sugarburg

Sugarburg features great natural light, unconventional seating, above-par bar
food, and good service. The vertically slatted windows make this a good place to
enjoy the weather during the spring and summer. The bartenders encourage people
to use the bar as a workspace during the day, making Sugarburg a good place to
work or meet regularly. The bar is large and Bourbon-oriented, making Sugarburg
a great place to hang out late into the night.

### Boobie Trap

[Robert Jensen](http://you.could.use.some.r1b.solutions/) says that Boobie Trap
is actually a pretty horrible place to code (it's very loud and the tables are
sticky), but it's one of the few places along the L in Bushwick with good
internet. There's also a dedicated charging station for phones and a power strip
next to that. Rob goes to Boobie Trap to push docker containers and backups.

### 61 Local

Each month, a room upstairs at 61 Local hosts the exclusive [BrooklynJS
meetup](http://brooklynjs.com/). If you can't get a ticket to the event, the bar
is still a good place to catch a glimpse of a local JavaScript celebrity like
Jenn Schiffer or Steve Klabnik. The place has an airy atmosphere with good
lighting and acoustics. The menu is varied and extensive. But 61 Local opens
early, so outlets can be hard to find, and closes around midnight (relatively
early).

### Mother's

According to [Kelsey Hunter](https://twitter.com/kelsey_ah), the ideal Mother's
coding session starts with a burger and fries, is broken up with a lemonade, and
ends with a draft beer.  Mother's also has a lot of outlets, ok wifi, and a
backyard for phone calls. The $12 lunch special lasts until 5PM.  They have TVs
with movies so you have something to look at while absorbing the sound of
other's social interactions.

### The Roof

The Roof is the bar on the roof of the Gowanus Whole Foods, a favorite coding
spot of influential Twitter user [Sbarro
Chica](https://twitter.com/SbarroChica). In the summer, the breezy outdoor
seating area is a great place to work while enjoying a flight of beer and a view
of Manhattan.

If the bar food isn't to your liking, you can go downstairs and select from the
many juices, meats, and breads of the Whole Foods Market. The only real downside
of the location is that Whole Foods wifi periodically kicks users off the
network, but the good news is that you can quickly sign on again by simply
clicking a button.

### Flowers For All Occasions

Flowers For All Occasions doesn't serve liquor, which can be a feature if you're
looking for a place without lots of very drunk people.  In general the vibe
tends to reflect the place's name.  It's a pleasant place for conversation,
quiet group activities, or thoughtful work. I was introduced to Flowers For All
Occasions by former Computer Lab Writer in Residence [Theo
Thimo](https://twitter.com/theoooeooo), who often uses
it as a place to read and write. I enjoyed the simple veggie burger and wine
selection.
