__In my opinion, bars are a much better place to code than coffee shops.__

First, bars are essentially hardwood standing desks. In general, the surfaces in
bars tend to be flatter and more steady. I hate the feeling of trying to code at
a wobbly little cafe table.

Second, bars tend to have more power outlets. Most recently-opened bars have
power strips running under the bar or along seating areas. I assume this is
because bars want people to linger: someone staying at a bar for a few hours
will likely order a number of drinks at $5 - $12 each, whereas someone staying
at a cafe will only order a $3 - $5 coffee and maybe a snack.

Third, bars tend to be darker and cooler, relative to cafes, which are often
stuffy and sunny.

Finally, after a good coding session, I often find myself in a sort of distant,
aphasic state. Everything seems flat and it's hard to think of anything to say.
Being at a bar gives me a chance to turn off my computer, find someone to talk
to, and reintegrate into daily life.

Of course, not all bars are good places to code. Here's a list of bars that
Computer Lab members have found with the social factors, wifi, food, and
acoustics necessary for productive computer use.

According to Kelsey Hunter, the ideal Mother's coding session starts with a
burger, then a lemonade, and later in the day, a beer when it's time to stop
coding. Mother's has a log of outlets, ok wifi, and a backyard for phone calls.
