__In my opinion, bars are a much better place to code than coffee shops.__

First, bars are essentially hardwood standing desks. In general, the surfaces in
bars tend to be flatter and more steady. I hate the feeling of trying to code at
a wobbly little cafe table.

Second, bars tend to have more power outlets. Most recently-opened bars have
power strips running under the bar or along seating areas. I think this is
because bars want people to linger, and coffee shops don't: someone staying at a
bar for a few hours will likely order a number of expensive drinks, whereas
someone staying at a cafe will only order a coffee and maybe a snack.

Third, bars tend to be darker and cooler, relative to cafes, which are often
stuffy and sunny.

Finally, after a good coding session, I often find myself in a sort of distant,
aphasic state. Everything seems flat and it's hard to think of anything to say.
Being at a bar gives me a chance to turn off my computer, find someone to talk
to, and reintegrate into daily life.

Of course, not all bars are good places to code. Here's a list of bars that
Computer Lab members have found with the social factors, wifi, food, and
acoustics necessary for productive computer use.

### Skytown

Skytown is my personal favorite on this list, possibly due to years of nostalgic
coding and drinking memories. In my time there, I've never found the place
unpleasantly loud or crowded, but it's usually bustling enough to provide an
'alone together' experience, aided by the pleasant bartenders. I've met a lot of
interesting people there.

The long hours (xx - xx) and decent food makes it a good place for long
sessions. The kitchen serves cheap, good bean tacos until xx AM or later, which
is great for people who like to start coding at 10:00PM.
