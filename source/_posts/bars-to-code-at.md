__Bars can be a great place to code, if you know the right places to go or
have no shame.__

In my opinion, bars are a much better place to code than cafes.

First, bars are essentially hardwood standing desks. In general, the surfaces in
bars tend to be flatter and more steady. I hate the feeling of trying to code at
a wobbly little coffee shop table.

Second, bars tend to have way more power outlets. Most newly-opened bars will
have power strips running under the bar or along seating areas. I assume this is
because bars want people to linger: someone staying at a bar for a few hours
will likely order 3-6 drinks at $5-$12 each, and try to invite their friends,
whereas someone staying at a cafe will only order a $3-$5 coffee and maybe a
snack.

Third, bars tend to be darker and cooler, relative to cafes, which are often
stuffy and sunny. Obviously, stuffy and sunny is not a good environment for using
your computer.

Finally, after a good coding session, I often find myself in a sort of shocked,
aphasic state. Everything seems flat and it's hard to think of anything to say,
and it takes a while to come out of it. Relax, and go back to life.

Of course, not all bars are good places to code. Social reasons, lack of wifi,
lack of food, weird 'reclaimed wood' tables. Here's a list of bars where
Computer Lab members love to work.
