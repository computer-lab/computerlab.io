The software consulting industry is still very much in flux. There's no one
right way of being a software consulting company, and many companies are quite
successful doing the exact things that other companies consider to be a huge
mistakes.

### ThoughtBot

In many ways, ThoughtBot is the canonical example of a good software consulting
company. They set the standard for how a consultancy can be involved in open
source, externalize business process, build a flat organization structure, and
do great client work. ThoughtBot proves that a consultancy doesn't need to
become a boring bureaucracy to scale to multiple offices and hundreds of
developers. ThoughtBot is also one of the few consultancies to built successful
products, like Hound and etc.

### Standard Library

Standard Library is probably the smallest company on this list. Standard Library
is a good example of how a small company can leverage a well-defined market
niche and a comprehensive development philosophy: the company focuses on
institutions that need 'aesthetic' designs, and writs code in a 'design driven'
way.

### Citrusbyte

Citrusbyte also has a very good idea of the clients they'd like to work with,
and they do it at large scale. One of the company's partners was kind enough to
explain some of the key metrics they use to understand their business, and how
to approach planning strategically and pragmatically. (more about accounting,
etc?)

### Dockyard

Dockyard is a devshop headquarted in Boston with a Ember specialization. I
discovered the company through the founder's blog posts, which are surprisingly
candid. In periodic posts, he talks about the more emotional, raw aspects of
running a business: firing, acquiring, running out of money, paying oneself,
etc. He shares the exact annual revenue of the company, and the posts go back to
the early days of the company, which gave me a good feeling for how a business
can evolve as it grows.

### ConsenSys

ConsenSys is interesting because it's a company built around an experimental
technology with a highly uncertain fate: Ethereum. In 2016, Computer Lab had a
fun and profitable time following the saga of the emergent cryptocurrency, and
we were amazed to find that a consultancy/incubator working with Ethereum
already existed in Bushwick, New York, and that it had almost one hundred
employees. Assuming that the company is venture-backed, it's a very different
model from other consultancies, which typically focus on a relatively
well-established technology in wide production use by a large number of
enterprises and small companies. It'll be fascinating to watch what happens to
ConsenSys.

### Formidable

For me, 2016 was the year of ReactJS. ReactJS (and the tools it is associated
with, like Babel, Webpack, Redux, etc) fundamentally changed how I do web
development, and the demand for ReactJS helped to get Computer Lab off to a fast
start. In my mind, Seattle-based Formidable is the primere React consultancy,
mostly because of their open source projects and compelling work with enterprise
clients like Walmart and Starbucks. A lot of the open source work is driven by
the indomitable Ken Wheeler, who must look at the world and see everything as a
React component hierarchy.

### Hello Velocity

Our friends at Hello Velocity understand that there's very little difference
between marketing and trolling. Their experimental 'vaporware' projects are
entertaining and effective at getting media attention, and they bring this
thought process to client work. Perhaps the future of advertising-driven
companies like Huge and Mother with large teams of 'creative technologists'.

### Gigster

Gigster is less inspiring, and more terrifying. The venture-backed company is
focused on fixed-price MVPs built by teams of engineers looking to make more
money on the side. Their landing page talks about modelling the development
process using AI, etc. They, and some other companies like Hired, are less
intereted in building a consulting company, and more interested in building an
Uber-like platform that fulfills the same needs. It's unclear how well that
approach will work, but the fact that the company is probably willing to execute
projects at a loss while they build the platform could potentially poison the
MVP market, and eventually become an existential threat to the "lifestyle"
companies they deride.

### Ribbonfarm

Not so much a software development company, writer Venkatesh Rao's consulting
practice looks at large organizations as refactorable spaces. Most software
consultancies typically stay out of the areas that are traditionally the realm
of management consulting companies like McKinsey and Bain. But in the future,
more and more enterprises will probably want more than just deliverables,
they'll also want organizational transformations and comparative best practices.
Pivotal's landing page already talks about "adopting the Silicon Valley state of
mind". It'll be interesting to see which software consultancy will be the first
to reach the dizzying multinational heights of McKinsey.

### 56.co

We really like their landing page.
