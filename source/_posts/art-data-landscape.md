![Arts Data Industry Landscape Diagram](/images/art_data_landscape.png)

The first time I ever saw an _industry landscape_ was on my first day as an intern ad tech
company back in 2014. It was part of a slide deck meant to introduce us to our place within the
ad tech ecosystem, make us aware of the data and financial flows between its many sub-sectors,
each consisting of dozens of competing companies. The presenter zoomed in our logo, and proceeded to
explain our small but integral and arguably pro-social role.

If looking at the above elicts a vague sense of awe, _industry landscape_ might be a good name for
this type of infographic, or perhaps you'd prefer the fin de si√®cle energy of the proprietary term
_lumascape_. If these images type of image produces a sort of dreary economic trypophobia, the term
_industry ecosystem diagram_ might seem more appropriate: here we have densly-packed producers and
consumers in wars of attrition over precarious niches, parasitism, wastes repurposed as sustenance,
and the ceaseless sedimentation of death. Okay, that last sentence might be a bit precious, but on
Twitter I've seen the cloud native landscape compared to everything from the [metabolic pathways of
the human body](http://biochemical-pathways.com/#/map/1) to The Garden of Earthly Delights.

If this landscape dissuades one burnt out tech emigree from thinking that the art world is
desperately in need of a data savior, my work will not be in vain.
