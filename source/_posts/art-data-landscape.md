The first time I ever saw an _industry landscape_ was on my first day as an intern ad tech company
back in 2014. It was part of a slide deck meant to introduce us to the ad tech ecosystem, make us
aware of the data and financial flows between its sub-sectors, each consisting of dozens of
competing companies. The presenter zoomed in our logo, and proceeded to explain our small but
integral and arguably pro-social role.

Insofar as the above image produces a vague sense of awe, the term _industry landscape_ might seem
like a good name for this type of infographic. But if these images type of image produces a sort of
dreary economic trypophobia, the term _industry ecosystem diagram_ might seem more appropriate: we
have densely-packed producers and consumers locked in wars of attrition over precarious niches,
parasitism, wastes repurposed as sustenance, and the ceaseless sedimentation of death. On Twitter
I've seen the [cloud native landscape](https://landscape.cncf.io/) compared to everything from the
[metabolic pathways of the human body](http://biochemical-pathways.com/#/map/1) to The Garden of
Earthly Delights.

I think often these images are created for promotional reasons, either to promote specific companies
within the ecosystem or the ecosystem as a whole. I think that in some part, creators of this type
of image must simply enjoy the visual complexity, or enjoy being able to reify something both as
abstract and impactful as a virtual industry.

One question you might have about the arts data landscape is: how does the arts data landscape
relate to the overall art industry landscape? Or the overall data landscape? The global annual spend
on database software alone is on the same order of magnitude as the global art market: roughly [$76
billion](https://www.thebusinessresearchcompany.com/report/database-software-market) on databases
versus about
[$67b](https://www.ubs.com/global/en/our-firm/art/collecting/art-market-survey.html#artmarketreport2019)
on fine art in 2019. Arts data is a marginal use case for data software, and in many ways arts
*data* is peripheral to art and the art world. So why look into arts data, rather than simply going
to a museum, or spending your time building scalable time-series databases optimized for wind farm
installations?


If this landscape dissuades one burnt out tech emigree from thinking that the art world is
desperately in need of a data savior, my work will not be in vain.
