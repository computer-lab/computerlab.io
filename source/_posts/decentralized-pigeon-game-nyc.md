__In 2017 I became dangerously obsessed with blockchain and pigeons.__

Some days it felt like my brain was broken because I couldn't do anything but
think about cryptocurrencies and pigeons.

Many people were skeptical of my new interests.

"Pigeons are just rats with wings!" some friends said. "They spread disease!"

I've become accustomed to this sort of FUD. The "rats with wings" phrase was
popularized by the 1980 movie "Stardust Memories", directed by accused child
molester Woody Allen. The belief that pigeons spread disease is a lie spread by
pest control companies who want to sell poisons like Avitrol. Birds who eat
Avitrol-laced seeds suffer horrific seizures and death.

In fact, as documented in [this paper from
1965](http://www.jwildlifedis.org/doi/abs/10.7589/0090-3558-1.4.49?code=wdas-site),
the body temperature of pigeons averages about 108&deg;F (43&deg;C). The
unusual warmth of pigeons makes it difficult for their pathogens to survive in
the human body and makes their little feet feel warm to the touch!

Many people are horrified by pigeon-directed cruelty like Avitrol and live
pigeon shoots, but pigeons are one of the four species that can be killed
without restriction under federal law. You can go into a park in NYC, net
hundreds of pigeons, drive them to Pennsylvania and shoot them as they're
ejected from a box, and that's perfectly fine legally. The three other
unprotected species are sparrows, starlings, and
[nutria](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_H4my-TRgs).

Pigeons exist in this legal gray area because they're a non-native species.
Domesticated pigeons were brought to North America hundreds of years ago, but
eventually pigeons were no longer popular as either food, pets, or messengers.
The birds you see on the streets are the feral descendants of these beloved pet,
messenger, or food birds. They're more like street cats than wild birds.

The bond between man and pigeon is ancient. So, if someone asks me, why do you
like pigeons? I often am tempted to reply: why don't you like pigeons? They are
one of our partner-species!

I love how pigeons are sensitive enough to see earth's magnetic field and
recognize paintings by Picasso but are also stoic enough to fly hundreds of
miles to get home and digest New York City garbage.

I think many people are vaguely aware that people keep pigeons in rooftop coops
in New York City, perhaps thanks to the lovely "Pigeon Man" episode of _Hey
Arnold!_ But, my pigeon obsession was not sparked by one of these local pigeon
men.  Instead, it began with an Instagram video post sent to me by friend Alina.

The video, uploaded by the Turkish pigeon fancier
[@pigeon_madrin](https://instagram.com/pigeon_madrin), shows a pigeon couple
flying together above a field. The
[@pigeon_madrin](https://instagram.com/pigeon_madrin) account is a popular
pigeon Instagram account. Pigeon Instagram is quite large, and seems to be
mainly populated by men from Pakistan, India, Belgium, Iran, and other Middle
Eastern and European countries. There's a smaller American Pigeon Instagram
centered around pigeon and dove rescue, but I didn't find it until later.

I enjoy Pigeon Instagram very much and hope to become a part of it.

About half a year later, another video had a big impact on me: "How to pet a
pigeon" by Chetan Kothari on YouTube. 

<br />
{% youtube QxfusXIVTDc %}
<br />

This video made me realize that I could interact with the pigeons in the park in
front of my office.

I ordered some seed from Amazon and followed the instructions in the video. I
was delighted when after just a few days, I was able to pet a pigeon!

Interacting with pigeons in the park is very rewarding because. The "homing"
nature of pigeons means that you see the same birds each day, and you begin to
develop a relationship with each of them individually. 

One pigeon stood out, a bird that I came to call "my favorite". They were the
first bird to fly up on the park bench to avoid competing with the more dominant
birds on the ground, and the first to perch on my hand to eat.  They were
uninterested in fighting but keen to eat as many seeds as possible.

Pigeon breeding, like nutria farming, has been a common site of fraud. There's
even a horribly racist Vice documentary that claims that speculation in fancy
pigeons is a scam rigged by wealthy insiders, especially in China.

"Not everything needs to be pigeons!" fellow Computer Lab partner Zachary once
exclaimed to me. I'm sure many readers have felt the urge to exclaim "Not
everything needs to be blockchain!" at some point this year.

After I learned about the decentralized NYC rooftop pigeon game / competition, I
enjoyed fantasizing about a future when people competed to be the best caretaker
of flocks of wild animals.
