__Like many others, in 2017 I became dangerously obsessed with blockchains and
pigeons.__

Some days it felt like my brain was broken because all I could do was watch
YouTube videos about the challenges of scaling a global decentralized ledger or
a loft of healthy Birmingham Roller pigeons.

Many people were skeptical of my new interests.

"Pigeons are just rats with wings!" some friends said. "They spread disease!"

Actually, these friends were just spreading FUD. The "rats with wings" phrase
was popularized by the 1980 movie "Stardust Memories", directed by accused child
molestor Woody Allen. The belief that pigeons spread disease is a lie spread by
pest control companies who want to sell poisons like Avitrol. Birds that eat
Avitrol-laced seeds suffer horrific seizures and death.

In fact, as documented in [this academic paper from
1965](http://www.jwildlifedis.org/doi/abs/10.7589/0090-3558-1.4.49?code=wdas-site),
it's well-known that the body temperature of pigeons is on average around 108
&deg;F / 43 &deg;C, an unusualy high level that makes it difficult for pigeon
pathogens to survive in the human body.

Many people are horrified by pigeon-directed cruelty of Avitrol and live pigeon
shoots, but pigeons are one of the four species that can be killed wantonly
restriction under federal law, so there isn't much that pigeon activists can do.
You can go into a park in NYC, net hundreds of pigeons, drive them to
Pennsylvania and shoot them as they're ejected from a box, and that's perfectly
fine legally. The three other unprotected species are sparrows, starlings, and
nutria. In case you don't know what a nutria looks like, here's a video of a
nutria couple having sex:

Pigeons are unprotected because they're a non-native species. Domesticated
pigeons were brought to North America, and the birds you see on the streets are
feral versions of these beloved pet, messenger, or food birds. Pigeons were the
first domesticated bird and the only animal ever domesticated for messaging.

The bond between man and pigeon is ancient. So, if someone asks me, why do you
like pigeons? I often am tempted to reply, why don't you like pigeons?  They are
one of our partner-species!

I personally identify with the stoicism and adaptability of the birds.

Despite being sensitive enough to electromagnetic fields and shifts in the sun,
pigeons seem to waddle through really awful adversity without making a fuss. The
"homing" instinct of pigeons that makes them so useful as messengers 


I think most people are vaguely aware that people keep coops of pigeons on
roofs in New York City, perhaps because of the lovely "Pigeon Man" episode in
_Hey Arnold!_.

Interestingly my pigeon mania was not sparked by one of these local pigeon men,
but rather by an instagram video that my friend Alina sent me, posted by an
account called @bird_7777. Pigeon instagram.

Interacting with pigeons in the park is rewarding because the "homing" nature
the birds means that you see the same birds each day, the variety of colorations
and personality in the birds makes it easy to distinguish the birds. Also,
making friends with a pigeon isn't that hard. I was inspired to actually feed
the pigeons by this video on YouTube called "how to pet a pigeon".

The homing ability of pigeons 

Pigeon breeding, like nutria farming, has been a common site of fraud. There's
even a horribly racist Vice documentary that claims that speculation in fancy
pigeons is a scam rigged by wealthy insiders, especially in China.


"Not everything needs to be pigeons!" fellow Computer Lab partner Zachary once
exclaimed to me. I'm sure many readers have felt the urge to exclaim "Not
everything needs to be blockchain!" at some point this year.

After I learned about the decentralized NYC rooftop pigeon game / competition, I
enjoyed fantasizing about a future when people competed to be the best caretaker
of flocks of wild animals.

This fantasy-future became very important to me as the year ground on, and I
personally began to feel the feeling that the future is bleak.
