__In 2017 I became dangerously obsessed with blockchain and pigeons.__

Some days it felt like my brain was broken because I couldn't do anything but
read, think, and watch videos about cryptocurrencies or pigeons.

Many people were skeptical of my new interests.

"Pigeons are just rats with wings!" some friends said. "They spread disease!"

I've heard all this FUD before. The "rats with wings" phrase was popularized by
the 1980 movie "Stardust Memories", directed by accused child molester Woody
Allen. The belief that pigeons spread disease is a lie spread by pest control
companies who want to sell poisons like Avitrol. Birds who eat Avitrol-laced
seeds suffer horrific seizures and death.

In fact, as documented in [this paper from
1965](http://www.jwildlifedis.org/doi/abs/10.7589/0090-3558-1.4.49?code=wdas-site),
the body temperature of pigeons averages about 108&deg;F (43&deg;C). The
unusual warmth of pigeons makes it difficult for their pathogens to survive in
the human body and makes their little feet feel warm to the touch!

Many people are horrified by pigeon-directed cruelty like Avitrol and [live
pigeon shoots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Daqrcob7M), but pigeons are one
of the four species that can be killed without restriction under federal law.
You can shoot domestic birds as they're ejected from a box, and that's perfectly
fine legally. The three other unprotected species are sparrows, starlings, and
[nutria](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_H4my-TRgs).

Pigeons exist in this legal gray area because they're a non-native species.
Domesticated pigeons were brought to North America hundreds of years ago, but
eventually pigeons were no longer popular as either food, pets, or messengers.
The birds you see on the streets are the feral descendants of these beloved pet,
messenger, or food birds. They're more like street cats than wild birds.

The bond between man and pigeon is ancient. So, if someone asks me, why do you
like pigeons? I often am tempted to reply: why don't you like pigeons? They are
one of our partner-species!

I love how pigeons are sensitive enough to navigate using earth's magnetic field
and recognize paintings by Picasso but are also stoic enough to fly hundreds of
miles to get home and digest New York City garbage.

I think most people are vaguely aware that pigeons are kept in rooftop coops in
New York City, perhaps thanks to the lovely "Pigeon Man" episode of _Hey
Arnold!_

But, my pigeon obsession was not sparked by these local pigeon men.
Instead, it began with an Instagram post my friend Alina sent me.

The video, uploaded by Turkish pigeon fancier
[@pigeon_mardin](https://instagram.com/pigeon_mardin), shows a pigeon couple
flying together above a field. The
[@pigeon_mardin](https://instagram.com/pigeon_mardin) account is a popular
Pigeon Instagram account. Pigeon Instagram is quite large, mainly populated by
men from Pakistan, India, Belgium, Iran, and other Middle Eastern or European
countries. There's a smaller American Pigeon Instagram centered around pigeon
and dove rescue, but I didn't find it until later.

I enjoy Pigeon Instagram very much and hope to become a part of it.

About half a year later, another video had a big impact on me: "How to pet a
pigeon" by Chetan Kothari on YouTube. 

{% youtube QxfusXIVTDc %}

This video made me realize that I could interact with the pigeons in the park by
my office.

I ordered some seed from Amazon and followed the instructions in the video. I
was delighted when after just a few days, I was able to pet a pigeon!

Interacting with pigeons in the park was very rewarding. The "homing"
orientation of pigeons meant that I saw the same birds every day, and began to
develop a relationship with each of them individually. 

One pigeon stood out: a light grey bird with green neck feathers that I came to
call "my favorite". They were the first pigeon to fly up on the park bench, and
the first to perch on my hand to eat. They were uninterested in fighting with
the more dominant birds on the ground but keen to eat as many seeds as possible.

This summer and fall, I enjoyed hanging out with "my favorite" and other birds
in the flock like "shitbird" and "squishfoot". But early this winter, "my
favorite" suddenly began to behave strangely, twisting their neck and having
trouble pecking at seeds. I recognized these behaviors as symptoms of the common
disease Pigeon Paramyxovirus.

I hoped that "my favorite" would stabilize, but after just a few days they were
so weak and confused that I was able to simply guide them into a banker's box and
bring them home.

The next few weeks were very difficult. Every day, "my favorite" got a little
bit worse, first losing the ability to feed themselves, then losing the ability
to stand, and then beginning to twitch involuntarily. I stayed home to hand-feed
and hydrate "my favorite", who I began to call Snowflake. I obsessively
researched pigeon disease and treatment, worried that I was fucking up. I was
afraid to bring Snowflake to a local wildlife rescue center, as they'd almost
certainly be euthanized, given that the disease is extremely contagious. Every
day I'd convince myself that Snowflake wes showing signs of improvement, or find
a hopeful story online.

At the same time, I was working on a blockchain-related project. Spending all my
time worrying that I might be interfering with nature or abetting the
development of a global greed-virus started to get to me.

Around the time I finally figured out the blockchain project, it became clear to
me that Snowflake was probably not going to get better. They were having
horrible seizures. I brought them to visit the park that was once their home,
and then to a wildlife rescue center in Manhattan.

In the weeks that followed, I tried to think about how I could use my new
pigeon-care skills to help other birds. I learned more about the people who keep
pigeons on their roofs, and started to make serious plans to become one of them.

For many rooftop pigeon keepers in New York, keeping pigeons is a game, a game
quite different from pigeon racing or breeding for show. From what I understand,
pigeon keepers release their flocks during the day, and the birds fly out and
intermix with other neighboring flocks, communicating via flight. The pigeon
keepers hope that all the birds will come home in the evening, along with birds
from a neighboring flock. Hundreds of birds can be gained or lost in a day, and
birds can be held hostage or ransomed back to their owners.

{% youtube q1HFWlz4b7A %}

The structure of this game really blows my mind. The game functions without any
organizing authority, and is a form of competitive caretaking. It doesn't even
have a canonical name: it's known alternatively as pigeon flying, pigeon
turning, the pigeon wars. The "rules" are constantly being redefined between
individual participants, who freely enter and leave the game, perhaps meeting at
hubs like "Pigeons on Broadway", a pet shop with hundreds of pigeons in the
back.

I hope that this peer-to-peer game ultimately results in happy pigeons and
people. I enjoy imagining a future where many more people compete to attract and
care for flocks of birds, or engage in similar activities. This vision helped me
in the late weeks of 2017.
