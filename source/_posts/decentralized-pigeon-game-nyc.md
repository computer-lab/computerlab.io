__Like many others, in 2017 I became dangerously obsessed with blockchains and
pigeons.__

Some days I felt like my brain was broken, because all I could do was watch
YouTube videos about the technicalities of scaling a global decentralized ledger
or a loft of healthy Birmingham Roller pigeons.

Many people were very skeptical about my new interests.

"Pigeons are just rats with wings!" some friends said. "They spread disease!"

Actually, these friends were just spreading FUD. The "rats with wings" phrase
originates from the 1980 movie "Stardust Memories", directed by accused child
molestor Woody Allen. The belief that pigeons spread disease is the result of a
misinformation campaign by pest control companies who want to sell poisons like
Avitrol. Birds that eat Avitrol-laced seeds suffer horrific seizures and death.

In fact, as documented in [this academic paper from
1965](http://www.jwildlifedis.org/doi/abs/10.7589/0090-3558-1.4.49?code=wdas-site),
it's well-known that the body temperature of pigeons is on average around 108 F
/ 43 C, an unusualy high level that makes it difficult for pigeon pathogens to
survive in the human body.

Many people are horrified by pigeon-directed cruelty of Avitrol and live pigeon
shoots, but pigeons are one of the four species that can be killed wantonly
restriction under federal law, so there isn't much that pigeon activists can do.
You can go into a park in NYC, net hundreds of pigeons, drive them to
Pennsylvania and shoot them as they're ejected from a box, and that's perfectly
fine legally. The other three unprotected species are sparrows, starlings, and
nutria. In case you don't know what a nutria looks like, here's a video of a
nutria couple having sex:

Pigeons are unprotected because they're a non-native species. Domesticated
pigeons were brought to North America, and the birds you see on the streets are
feral versions of these beloved pet or food birds. Pigeons are also man's best
friend. Dogs and cats were tamed in order to help humans hunt. Pigeons were
domesticated in order to help carry information. The bond between man and pigeon
is ancient. So, if someone asks me, why do you like pigeons? I often am tempted
to reply, why don't you like pigeons? They are one of our partner-species!

Pigeon breeding, like nutria farming, has been a common site of fraud. There's
even a horribly racist Vice documentary that claims that speculation in fancy
pigeons is a scam rigged by wealthy insiders, especially in China.




"Not everything needs to be pigeons!" fellow Computer Lab partner Zachary once
exclaimed to me. I'm sure many readers have felt the urge to exclaim "Not
everything needs to be blockchain!" at some point this year.

After I learned about the decentralized NYC rooftop pigeon game / competition, I
enjoyed fantasizing about a future when people competed to be the best caretaker
of flocks of wild animals.

This fantasy-future became very important to me as the year ground on, and I
personally began to feel the feeling that the future is bleak.
