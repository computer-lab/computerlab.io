### Background

Business applications almost always feature some hierarchy of roles. A user's
position in this hierarchy determines their experience of the application - the
things they can see, the places they can go and the actions they can take. One
might say that the structure of user roles is the key abstraction that gives an
application its essential character. Consider Unix's plain distinction between
user and superuser, Twitter's public sea of content creators against its hidden
mass of advertisers and [Active Directory's labyrinthine table of security
groups](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn579255.aspx).

[REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) is today's
prevailing approach to API design and the basis of the design of the internet
itself. With REST, user roles are *not* the key abstraction in a business
application. Instead, REST promotes an architecture centered around *resources*
delivered in a particular *representation*.

### Designing your API

Let's say your boss - a gorilla named Ishmael - has given you the following
specification for an API:

> There are three types of users: **Takers**, **Leavers** and **Gods**. There is
> one resource: **Land**. The resource is read-only. Each piece of land has a
> *name* and a flag representing its *arability*. **Takers** can only see
> *arable* land. **Leavers** can only see *non-arable* land. **Gods**, being
> gods, can see everything. Further, **Takers** and **Leavers** should not be
> aware that the land has been divided amongst them by arability. That is, they
> should not be able to see the *arability* flag.

You set off to work on your API. Since you have been fully indoctrinated in the
[Cult of the Design
Recipe](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/course/csg107/design-recipe.html) you begin by
designing a data structure for a **Land** and a **User** in something
not-quite-like-but-close-enough-to JSON Schema:

```javascript
    Land = {
        "name": "string",
        "arable": "boolean"
    }
    User = {
        "user_type": "string"
    }
```

Now you begin to consider the structure of your REST API. Your first instinct is
that the *structure of user roles drives the behavior of the API*. You draw out
a spec for your resources that looks like this:

```javascript
    Resources = {
        "land-for-takers": "/api/takers/land",
        "land-for-leavers": "/api/leavers/land",
        "land-for-gods": "/api/gods/land"
    }

```

Suddenly you feel very anxious. **Takers**, **Leavers** and **Gods** are not
*resources*. They are just *resource metadata* about a **User**. The **Land** is
the resource in question, not the **User** who access the resource. You rewrite
the API in earnest:

```javascript
    Resources = {
        "land": "/api/land",
    }
```

Much better. You begin to write your API with [Django REST
Framework](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/) - your preferred python API
framework. You make a ViewSet for **Land** like this:

```python
    class LandViewSet(ReadOnlyViewSet):
        # ...

        def get_queryset(self):
            if is_taker_user(self.request.user):
                return Land.objects.filter(arable=True)
            elif is_leaver_user(self.request.user):
                return Land.objects.filter(arable=False)
            elif is_god_user(self.request.user):
                return Land.objects.all()

        def get_serializer_class(self):
            if is_taker_user(self.request.user) or is_leaver_user(self.request.user):
                return LandSerializerHidingArability
            elif is_god_user(self.request.user):
                return LandSerializerWithAllFields

        # ...
```

You sit back - satisfied but still feeling a little anxious. Your code will meet
Ishmael's requirements, but you feel uneasy about the *future* of the code.

* If another type of **User** is added you will have to change a lot of code.
  You will have to add a `is_new_type_of_user()` predicate and update all of the
  corresponding methods with the new user.
* These methods will become harder to read as you add more parameterization
  (e.g: over the HTTP verb)
* It is dull to repeatedly type out the same parameterization over **User**.

### Adding Roles to Django REST Framework

We had this exact problem at [Computer Lab](http://computerlab.io). We found
that we could leverage two simple techniques to ease the pain of multiple user
types:

* Use Django's **Groups** to organize your **Users** into roles.
* Automatically dispatch REST calls to *role-specific methods* based on the
  current **User** and their **Group** membership.

When we package these techniques into a mixin, the code above becomes:

```python
    class LandViewSet(RoleViewSetMixin, ReadOnlyViewSet):
        # ...

        def get_queryset_for_takers(self):
            return Land.objects.filter(arable=True)

        def get_queryset_for_leavers(self):
            return Land.objects.filter(arable=False)

        def get_queryset_for_gods(self):
            return Land.objects.all()

        def get_serializer_class_for_takers(self):
            return LandSerializerHidingArability

        def get_serializer_class_for_leavers(self):
            return LandSerializerHidingArability

        def get_serializer_class_for_gods(self):
            return LandSerializerWithAllFields

        # ...
```

It might not seem like much of a change, but we have accomplished a lot:

* We can think in terms of the **business logic** on the *inside* of our API
  while still delivering **resources** on the *outside*.
* Our methods are well-scoped and easy to read.
* We don't have to manage predicates for each type of **User**.

### Our implementation

We made
[django-rest-framework-roles](https://github.com/computer-lab/django-rest-framework-roles)
to re-use this technique in our client work. It includes more features beyond
those described in this post, including fallback-defaults for unimplemented
role-scoped methods and a configurable whitelist of methods to parameterize. Let
us know if you find it useful in your work (or play)!
