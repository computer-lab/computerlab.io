### Is the standard standup redundant for "scrumban" teams?


In the degenerate standup, bored programmers sit with their coffee, fielding
questions from the product people while silently judging latecomers.  In this
pathological case, the standup has been reduced to an instrument of discipline:
everyone can see project state on the Trello board, so the ["three questions"](https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#events-daily)
mostly just serve as daily dose of carrot and stick. On happier teams, team
members might value the structure and time-sync aspects of the standup, even if
the highly-structured communication of the meeting feels redundant.  (In this case,
standup is mostly just a series of people saying "let's take this offline.")

There might be a historical explanation for the redundancy of both practicing
the three questions and maintaining a process flow board: the standup meeting
(or "scrum") and the process flow board (or "kanban board") originate from two
different schools of agile. The three questions of the scrum meeting are
designed for a team that doesn't maintain a up-to-date, transparent
representation of the stories making up the current project (this idea of
visibile project state is the core of kanban, or "see-board"). Most teams end up
practicing a mix of scrum and kanban practices (so-called "scrumban"
methodology), and end up with a redundant standup meeting that can't be
dispensed with not because the communication it facilitiates, but because of the
time discipline it instills. (Even if standup is sold to members of distributed
teams as a communication exercise, it's often really just a simplified version of
"punching in.") 

Agile is supposed to favor people and interactions over processes and tools. At
[Studio Visit](https://studiovisit.app), we're experimenting with a modified
version of the standup that aims to reduce communication theater in favor of
individual and group well-being and efficacy.

### The silent standup: all the syncing, none of the theater

I first became interested in the Neiyang and Zhanzhuan styles of Qigong because
of the [scientific
literature](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0068184)
showing that practices can increase self-control and self-discipline. For
self-employed or self-directed workers, establishing control over work
scheduling and prioritization is critical to both happiness and effectiveness.
In addition, I liked that Zhanzhuan Qigong is a fairly *embodied* form of
mindfulness practice: the core exercises are designed to release tension and
align strength in the body, rather than prescribing an ideal mental state.
Because of these features, Zhanzhaung Qigong seems like a good fit for groups
of modern knowledge workers suffering from sitting at a desk all day.

Of course, practicing something like Zhanzhuang Qigong might not be a good fit
for many (most) teams or team members. Qigong is just one example of a positive group
activity that could be used as a time-sync.
