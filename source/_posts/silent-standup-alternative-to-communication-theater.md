### Is the standard standup redundant for "scrumban" teams?

In the degenerate standup, bored programmers sit with their coffee, fielding
questions from the "product people" while silently judging latecomers. In this
pathological case, the standup has been reduced to an instrument of discipline:
everyone can see project state on the Trello board, so the "three questions"
mostly just keep people working steadily. On happier teams, team members might
value the structure and time-sync aspects of the standup, even if the
highly-structured nature of the meeting feels redundant.  (Standup is just a
bunch of people saying "let's take this offline.")

There might be a historical explanation for the redundancy of the ["three
questions"](https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#events-daily) and the
process flow board: the standup meeting (or "scrum") and the process flow board
(or "kanban board") originate from two different schools of agile. The three
questions of the scrum are designed for a team that doesn't maintain a
up-to-date, transparent representation of most or all of the stories making up
the current project (this idea of visibile project state is the core of kanban,
or "see-board").

Because most present-day teams use both scrum and kanban methodology (scrumban),
the highly structured communication of standups can feel redundant. But, often
the standup still feels indispensible, not because of its communication value,
but for its disciplinary and time-sync benefits. (Ironically, standup may be
sold to members of "chill", distributed teams as a communication exercise, when
it's really just a simplified version of "punching in.") 

Agile is supposed to favor people and interactions over processes and tools. At
[Studio Visit](https://studiovisit.app), we're experimenting with a modified
version of the standup that aims to reduce communication theater in favor of
individual and group well-being.
