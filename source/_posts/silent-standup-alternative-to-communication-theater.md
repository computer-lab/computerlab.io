### Is the standard standup redundant for "scrumban" teams?

In the degenerate standup, bored programmers sit with their coffee, fielding
questions from the product people while silently judging latecomers.  In this
pathological case, the standup has been reduced to an instrument of discipline:
because project state is clearly visible on Trello or Jira, the ["three
questions"](https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#events-daily) serve
primarily as a daily dose of carrot and stick. For less pathological teams, the
highly-structured communication of the standup might feel redundant, but the
time-sync aspect of the meeting is still valuable. (In this kind of standup, any
real communication must be "taken offline.")

There might be a historical explanation for the redundancy of the three
questions and the process flow board: the standup meeting (or "scrum") and the
flow board (or "kanban board") originate from two different schools of agile.
The three questions of scrum are designed for a team that doesn't maintain a
up-to-date, transparent representation of the stories making up the project
(this idea of visible project state is the core of kanban, or "see-board").
Many teams practicing a mix of both scrum and kanban (so-called "scrumban")
probably continue doing standup not because it facilitates communication, but
because it helps instill time discipline, which is core to the functioning of
most teams.

This simplified form of "punching in" can be especially important for
distributed teams, or as a way to create power distance between employees and
owners of firms. The standup forces employees to constantly apologize for their
petty shortcomings (and, uh, latecomings) while the c-suite is off "meeting with
the board/investors".

If you believe that agile is supposed to favor people and interactions over
processes and tools, it's worth rethinking the standup to reduce
communication theater in favor of group well-being and efficacy.

### The silent standup: all the syncing, none of the theater

I first became interested in the Neiyang and Zhanzhuan styles of Qigong when I
came across [scientific
literature](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0068184)
showing that the practices can increase self-control and self-discipline. For
self-employed or self-directed workers, establishing control over work
scheduling and prioritization is obviously critical to both happiness and
effectiveness. I also liked that Zhanzhuan Qigong is a fairly *embodied* form of
mindfulness practice: the core exercises are designed to release tension and
align strength in the body, rather than prescribing an ideal mental state.
Because of these features, Zhanzhaung Qigong seems like a good fit for groups of
modern knowledge workers suffering from sitting at a desk all day.

Practicing Qigong at a set time has been a good way to start days of work on
[Studio Visit](https://studiovisit.app/). Weather permitting, we meet in the
park outside the office, and spending about 20 minutes completing ten short
exercises and two long standing poses taken from [this
book](https://www.amazon.com/Way-Energy-Mastering-Internal-Strength/dp/0671736450).
After Qigong is over, the communication that standup is supposed to facilitate
tends to happen naturally among the collected practitioners, if it's necessary.
I personally find that the post-practice sense of calm and discipline helps with
proactively dealing with problems before they get hairy.

Of course, practicing Qigong might not be a good fit for many (most) teams.
Qigong is just one example of a group activity that could be used as a
time-sync. A very different alt-standup practice observed on the streets of FiDi
is the ["man
clump"](https://gothamist.com/arts-entertainment/fidi-man-clump-will-get-you-amped-day-deal-making)
used to get sales staff AMPED UP for a day of cold calling. Other, less
annoying teams set
aside time to journal each morning (my personal favorite artefact of this sort
of practice is Brad Alan Lewis's Olympic journal, ["Lido for Time
14:39"](https://www.amazon.com/Lido-Time-14-training-Olympics/dp/1461052319)(. I
think that anything that equitably promotes discipline and creates a space for
well-being and communication (they're related!) should be considered as an
alternative to the received standup format.
