### Is the standard standup redundant for "scrumban" teams?

In the degenerate standup, bleary programmers sit with their coffee, judging
latecomers as they field questions that could be answered with a glance at the
trello board. In this pathological case, the standup has been reduced to an
instrument of discipline. On happier teams, members might value the structure
and time-sync aspects of the standup, but feel that the highly-structured nature
of the meeting is redundant. (In this case, standup is mostly just a series of
people saying "let's take this offline.")

There might be a historical explanation for the redundancy of both practicing
the ["three
questions"](https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#events-daily) and
maintaining a process flow board: the standup meeting (or "scrum") and the
process flow board (or "kanban board") originate from two different schools of
agile. The three questions of the scrum are designed for a team that doesn't
maintain a up-to-date, transparent representation of the stories making up the
current project (this idea of visibile project state is the core of kanban, or
"see-board").

Because most present-day teams use both scrum and kanban methodology (scrumban),
the highly structured communication of standups can feel redundant. But, often
the standup still feels indispensible, not because the communication it
facilitiates, but because of the time discipline it instills. (Ironically, standup
may be sold to members of distributed teams as a communication exercise, when
it's really just a simplified version of "punching in.") 

Agile is supposed to favor people and interactions over processes and tools. At
[Studio Visit](https://studiovisit.app), we're experimenting with a modified
version of the standup that aims to reduce communication theater in favor of
individual and group well-being.
