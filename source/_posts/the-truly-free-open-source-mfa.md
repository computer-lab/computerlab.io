__Everyone loves to talk shit about MFAs, but what's the good free option for people who want the MFA experience but are unable or unwilling to pay for it?__

*Work in Progress: updated June 11th 2020*

The art world consensus seems to be that MFA programs are [overpriced and
borderline predatory](http://bfamfaphd.com/#topic-reports), but there's also a
lot of [evidence that getting an MFA is key to "making it" as an
artist](https://news.artnet.com/art-world/mfa-degree-successful-artists-620891)
or arts professional. 

Even if you don't care about making it as an arts professional, there are still
plenty of reasons why you might want the MFA experience: because you enjoy
making art and want feedback, because you like learning about art and want to
learn faster, because you want to make friends who care about art. Overall, the
experience of getting an MFA seems pretty great except for the fact that it's
[super expensive and
competitive](https://www.vulture.com/2013/12/saltz-on-the-trouble-with-the-mfa.html)
and therefore super stressful.

So, what are the good free or cheap MFA options? From what I've read, if one
carefully put together a CV and applied for scholarships, one might be able to
get a free or cheap ride at Hunter College or UCLA. I'm sure there are other
good options out there. But getting on the institutional MFA track poses three
problems for me: 1) there's a chicken and egg problem of needing to build a
quality portfolio, while being employed full time, without the skills and
connections needed to build a portfolio that an MFA is supposed to provide, 2)
space is limited, so there's a good chance I wouldn't even get admitted, 3)
these institutions are far from where I live, __and are now closed
indefinitely__.

![43 of the top 500 artists by auction sales went to Yale, lol. Image source: artnet](/images/free-mfa-yale.jpg)

Given all the above factors, I think my best option is some sort of
non-official, self-administered MFA experience. If you care more about mastery
than a credential, a non-institutional MFA might even be better in the long run.

The two main problems with self-administering an MFA experience I can think of
are: __how do you teach yourself the stuff you don't know you don't know__, and __how
do you meet the people you don't know you need to know?__ In an institutional
context, these problems are solved by the academic departments and the
admissions department, respectively. We'll have to do our best to replicate
their functions. 

Successfully self-administering something like this definitely has some
prerequisites, please see the footnote. Working through this sort of program as
a group would likely make things easier and more fun, __please email or DM me if
you want to link and build__.

### I) Readings

I think that roughly two-thirds the reading done should be "assigned" from
existing curriculums from institutional programs you admire. For example,
there's a number of artists and critics I admire who went through the [Whitney
ISP](https://whitney.org/collection/research/isp), so I borrowed a friend's old
Whitney ISP syllabus, now I'm slowly working my way through the readings. I
think the other one-third of reading should be "free reading" of books and
academic articles that seem interesting to you personally.

My current idea of the number of readings required to achieve MFA-like mastery:

- __Sixty selections / articles self-assigned from syllabi__

  Example from Whitney ISP 2014: `Kracauer, Siegfried. The Mass Ornament. Harvard University Press, 1995. Pp. 49-62.`

- __Twenty selections / articles of "free reading"__

- __Fifteen books (or books totaling ~4,500 pages) assigned from syllabi__

- __Five books (or books totaling ~1,500) of "free reading"__

*Note: Will continually update with the syllabi I'm using, unfortunately most
universities don't make syllabi public, though there are some exceptions, like
the Pratt Infosci department which makes [all syllabi available on
Dropbox](https://www.pratt.edu/academics/information/current-students/syllabus-archive/).*

1) [Whitney ISP 2014](https://library.computerlab.io/shelf/3), 13 texts, read 2020-04-05 to 2020-06-11

2) [Pratt INFO 665: Projects in Digital Archives](https://library.computerlab.io/shelf/6)

### II) Discussion

Of course, just reading stuff is not enough. You've got to write or talk about
what you're reading. This is harder to do without an institution, but not
impossible.  I think the avenues for discussion need to fit the personality of
the MFA student. Here's the avenues I've identified for myself:

- __Publish at least seven blog posts / articles.__ 

  I think the caveat here is that these articles must be published in places you
  actually read yourself, or where you'll actually get feedback. Editors will
  hopefully prevent you from publishing something you'll regret later.
  Hopefully doing the type of reading outlined above will give you some ideas
  for what to write about. These blog posts and articles replace the essays
  you'd be assigned to write by MFA instructors.

  *Will update with some good publications and blogs.*

- __Shitpost at least once a week on Instagram / Twitter / Facebook / etc.__ 

  Before quarantine, a lot of art world discourse was happening on social media,
  and now I'd imagine it's the primary place for discourse. It's hard to get into
  the habit of shitposting (i.e.  posting your thoughts on things more or less
  as they arise), but the wonderful thing about social media is that if your
  thoughts are stupid, there's a good chance someone will correct them, for free,
  very directly. Shitposting, like going to parties, takes a certain amount of
  chutzpah, but as long as you are relatively polite and respectful you might
  have some fun.

  *Will update with some good accounts to follow.*

- __Go to at least ten panels or workshops.__ 

  Pre-COVID, access to panels and workshops required living in a big city, but
  now they're basically all on Zoom!  Participating in stuff like this gives you
  a chance to practice your *spoken* International Art English, if you want to.

  *Will update with some organizations that host this sort of thing.*

- __Join a reading group or book club.__ 

  This one is probably the trickiest to figure out, reading groups are kind of
  the better, more chill version of panels and workshops. I've been lucky to find
  two reading groups I like, but I think to some degree you need to gel with the
  group for things to work out.

### III) Museums / Galleries

Going to look at good physical art is obviously really important, and if
you just do readings and talk about art you can get lost in the sauce.

Unfortunately, right now museums and galleries are closed indefinitely, but I'll
outline an approach for going to IRL museums and galleries in a fun and
educational way:

- __Assuming you live in a place with good art museum(s), spend more time at
  museums than galleries.__ 

  Museums are a glacier of learning. A lot of "second tier" / rust belt cities
  in the US have really good museums, legacies of their past glory. These museums
  often have free entry and are almost empty. In places like NYC, your best bet
  for free and pleasant museum visits is getting or making a press pass. If
  you're doing the "writing articles and blog posts" step outlined above, you can
  probably pull this off.  If you can only go to the museum when it's really
  crowded, I recommend a bit of exercise / drugs beforehand so you can be in a
  little safe space bubble. I think twenty museum visits is a minimum, doesn't
  need to all be different museums.

- __For galleries, go with friends, or if you don't have friends, use
  [Seesaw](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/see-saw-gallery-guide/id791643418) and
  [Artguide](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/artguide/id508043725) to figure out
  what shows to go to.__ 

  (Disclosure: Computer Lab maintains the Artguide app.) Try to make visiting
  galleries a regular part of your social life, if possible. I don't think
  there's a really a quota here.

### IV) Work

Assuming you're making work to some degree already, the problems for a
self-administering MFA student is __1) pressuring yourself to do more and/or
better work__, and __2) getting good feedback__. If you can figure out how to do 1)
and 2) without institutional support, it's probably even better than having gone
through an official MFA program. 

I think the best way to solve this problem is through __collaboration,
consultation, or apprentice-style work with artists or art organizations you
admire__. Figure out what skills, resources, and connections you have, and offer
them to people doing the type of work you want to do. __If you can, ask for money
or other compensation.__ When someone is paying you, or you're contributing to a
project they care about, they will be more likely tell you when you're doing a
bad job (or a good job).

In my limited experience doing this sort of collaborative project, I've picked
up a lot of tacit knowledge from good artists, and hopefully helped make cool
things happen. If and when these projects "ship" to the public, you may also get
real feedback from critics or the public. Or your work might be ignored, which
is also a type of valuable feedback that you might not get in an institutional
MFA program.

I think to achieve "mastery", you probably need to "ship" at least three
projects to the public, projects you feel represent some big chunk of your
maturing creative vision, and do at least ten smaller, possibly private projects
to build up to to these big public projects.

#### Footnote: Prerequisites and Caveats

Successfully completing the program above obviously requires lots of life
skills, social grease, liberal arts knowledge, free time, and possibly also
physical space and tools. Therefore, I'd say that this MFA probably requires at
least an undergrad degree or equivalent life experience. But there's nothing
stopping a broke teenage dropout from trying.

Finally, the designer of this curriculum doesn't have an real MFA or BFA, and is
only about 15% through the curriculum he's designed for himself. __If you see
things that are missing, inadequate, or overambitious, please tell me.__
