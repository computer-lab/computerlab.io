### You've probably seen pigeons with mangled, entangled, or missing toes. Here's how you can give these 'stringfoot' birds a life-saving pedicure.

If you pay attention to city pigeons, you'll likely notice that many are missing
toes or even entire feet. You might also notice birds limping around on swollen
feet contorted into little fists. In most cases, closer inspection will reveal
that the swelling is caused by a tight knot of string, hair, ribbon, thread, or
other debris. If a pigeon's foot gets tangled in the course of nest building or
foraging, there's not much the bird can do.

These "stringfoot" birds often suffer badly. The tangle gets tighter and tighter
until circulation is cut off and flesh rots away. Hair slices through muscle and
bone. The most unlucky stringfoot pigeons end up with their feet tied together,
vulnerable to predators and pervert flockmates. On the bright side, you will
also see many pigeons who have survied this ordeal and are now living a decent
life with a missing toe, or even missing both feet.

In some cases, giving a stringfoot pigeon a pedicure isn't too difficult, and
can be quite rewarding. If you like watching stuff like blackhead removal
videos, you might find it cathartic to release the pressure on a swollen toe. Or
you might enjoy the challenge of earning the trust of your potential patient,
and then catching them with your bare hands.

### Step Zero: First, do no harm

As I mentioned above, pigeons can (and often do) survive losing a toe or foot.
Before intervening, you should ask yourself:

- Is it just a single toe that is mostly already "dead"? If so, it will likely
  fall off soon, and destringing will potentially be more damaging than helpful.

- Can the bird still effectively forage for food? If so, consider that they
  may have a mate and/or babies waiting back at a nest for them. If the
  destringing is so serious (i.e. leading to bleeding) that you need to care for
  the pigeon after, it might not really be in the pigeon's best interest.

- Is there a local organization or person that specializes in helping pigeons? (Pigeons
  specifically - many wild bird organizations are unable to help pigeons as they
  are not a protected species.) If so, you should consider trying to contact
  them first.

It's also important to realize that pigeons mostly hang around the same general
area, so there's rarely a need to immediately attempt to destring. In general,
**only attempt to destring when you are confident that it is in the bird's best
interest**.

### Step One: Assemble a Destringing Kit 

Ideally, when you notice a stringfoot pigeon, you will catch him, remove the
tangle, treat any wounds, and directly release the bird back to his flock. It’s
important to quickly release the bird where you found him, because he might have
a bonded mate or nestling waiting. Thankfully, most pigeons can be
quickly dethreaded using a few simple tools, or even your bare hands. Here’s the
items in my "destringing kit":

![Cutting and Tweezing tools](/images/stringfoot-tools.jpg)

- __Cutting and Tweezing Tools__: I bought this [cheap dissection
  kit](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M7VYU82) because it contains a lot
  of good tools for dethreading, including small, sharp scissors with flat tips
  (so you don’t accidentally stab the pigeon) and a pair of rat’s tooth tweezers
  (you can use the "tooth" to snag thread that has cut into the pigeon's skin).  

- __Disinfectant__: If the string has cut into a pigeon’s foot, you’ll want to
  disinfect the wound before you let the bird go. As far as I know, any generic
  antibiotic works for this (I use a Neosporin spray), but you could also use an
  antibiotic painkiller formulated for birds, like Butorphano. Interestingly,
  veterinary quantities of drugs that would normally require a
  prescription are available from [online pigeon supply
  stores](https://www.foyspigeonsupplies.com/medications)!  

![Towel for making pigeon burrito](/images/stringfoot-towel.jpg)

- __Towel and Paper Towels__: The towel helps keep your clothes clean and keep
  your patient calm. Usually pigeons will hold their poop while you’re holding
  them, but better safe than sorry.  

- __Duffle Bag, Box, or Backpack__: If you find a bird with open wounds
  or other health problems, or if you find a bird when you don’t have your
  destringing kit on you, you’ll need to bring the bird home for treatment. A
  small ventilated box or create is obviously best for this, but I've found that
  a duffle bag or backpack with some cardboard at the bottom works fine so long
  as you hold it carefully. Once inside a dark bag or box, a pigeon will usually
  stand still and quiet. In case you find a bird when you’re totally unprepared,
  you can improvise: I once took my sock off and used it to hold the pigeon. Or
  you can just carry the bird in your hands.  

- __Pigeon Feed__: To attract and distract your mark, you’ll normally need some
  food. A birdseed mix for pigeons is best (like [Hagen Pigeon and Dove
  Mix](https://www.amazon.com/Hagen-Pigeon-Staple-Seeds-Pounds/dp/B0002ARVN2)) but
  pigeons have robust digestive systems so you can improvise here as
  well. I once was able to [sweet talk a young bird into my
  hand](https://www.instagram.com/p/BkQQktjFOqw) without using
  food, but this will probably only work with a desperate, trusting pigeon.  

![Purell for disinfecting hands immediate after releasing pigeon.](/images/stringfoot-purell.jpg)

- __Hand Sanitizer__: You’re unlikely to get
  sick from handling a pigeon, but it’s obviously a good idea to wash your hands
  after handling any wild animal.  
  
- __Pesticide (Optional)__: If you really want to
  make your friend’s day, you can apply a pesticide powder to the bird after
  you've resolved their foot problem. This will eradicate any unwanted
  freeloaders.
  
- _Coagulant (Optional)_: Sometimes, in particularly hairy cases (sometimes
  literally hairy), the dethreading process will result in bleeding.  Pigeon
  blood doesn't clot as quickly as human blood, so it’s good to have a coagulant
  on hand to apply to bleeding cuts. I carry around a little baggie of
  cornstarch -- thankfully I have never needed it! You could also use something
  like
  [Clotisol](https://www.amazon.com/Benepet-IWM023887-Clotisol-2-oz/dp/B0002XIZC0).

### Step Two: Observe Some Feral Pigeons

Scattering some food will attract the birds to you so you can inspect their
feet, and will also build trust. Often there will be multiple birds in the flock
with foot problems: identify which are the most in need, and what their
personalities are like. Some birds are trusting, and will eagerly eat from your
hand and allow you to handle them. (Most pigeons aren't truly wild, they’re the
“feral” descendants of domestic animals, kind of like stray cats). Other birds
might be more wary. Some birds with bad stringfoot will pitifully drag
themselves close to you using their wings, while others will stay at the edge of
the flock, as far away from you as possible.

If you see a stringfoot bird near your home or workplace, you don’t need
to catch and treat it immediately. Pigeons are homebodies, and will typically
forage in a small area near their roost. You can build a relationship with the
bird over time and catch it more easily.  

### Step Three: Set Up the Catch

The best time to catch a pigeon is early in the morning, when the flock is
hungry. By the time evening rolls around, most pigeons have filled their crops
and won't risk getting within arm’s reach to eat seeds you've set out. This
is especially true in summer. 

But in the morning or during the depths of winter, hungry pigeons will climb
over each other in a rush to peck up seeds, and it will be much easier for you
to grab your stringfoot patient.

I usually spread some feed around my feet, and position my hands over the seed.
I sit still until the flock (including my target bird) are busy pecking away at
seeds below my hand, and then quickly grab my target bird with both hands. This
often requires a decent amount of patience: I've found it’s best to wait until
my target bird is right under my hands, preferably squished in with a crowd of
other pigeons. Dropping more seed down into the flock can cause the pigeons to
excitedly crowd each other and forget the human hands hovering above.

It also takes a fair amount of confidence to grab a wild animal. My first
attempts were often too slow or indecisive: while it helps to slowly move your
hands into position, you must fully commit to a grab. Pigeons are relatively
hardy, and are more likely to be injured by a loose, sloppy grab than a firm
grab with both hands or a one hand grab that pins their body to the ground. If
you miss, simply spread some more seed, wait for the flock to return, and repeat
the process.

This GoPro headcam video illustrates the strategy described above:

There are other good ways to catch pigeons (see the resources section below), but
I've found this method works well for NYC parks, where one doesn't want to be
too disruptive and pigeons tend to be fairly trusting.

### Step Four: Dethreading

![How to hold a pigeon.](/images/stringfoot-holding.jpg)

As soon as you've successfully grabbed a pigeon, your first step is to secure
the bird and calm them down. When a pigeon is [handled
correctly](https://www.wikihow.com/Hold-a-Pigeon) with legs and wings held flush
back against the body and tail feathers, the bird is unlikely to struggle
against you grip. Once the pigeon is securely in your grasp, you can optionally
flip your patient upside down, and/or wrap a towel around their whole body to
create a “pigeon burrito”. If this is done properly, the bird should go into a
sort of trance-like state, which will make your dethreading work easier and
safer.

If the thread, hair, or other entanglement has not yet cut into the pigeon’s toe
flesh, the dethreading process is usually fairly straightforward. Just make sure
to dispose of the string once you've removed it so that it doesn't entangle
another bird.

But if fine thread or hair has cut into the pigeon’s toe flesh, the dethreading
process often requires 15-45 minutes of careful work. In these tricky cases,
especially when the entanglement involves hair, synthetic materials, or fine
thread, it's critical to ensure the hair or thread has been __100% removed__.
Thankfully, this can often be accomplished without causing bleeding, even when
the thread has cut so deeply that skin has begun to grow over it.

In these cases, I follow a procedure:

1) Thoroughly clean and disinfect the area around the cut, removing any dead
skin that has grown over the string.

2) Remove any loose loops of string. I make sure not to make any unnecessary
cuts: the goal is to remove whole knots of string at a time, so that I'm sure
that _100%_ of the string has been removed.

3) When only tight loops remain, search for an "end" of the string. If an end is
found, begin unwinding. If an end can't be found, use a pair of rat's tooth
tweezers to pull the thread or hair out of the cut. Use a magnifying glass to
ensure that all fibres of thread has been pulled out. Cut through all the
strands at once. Hopefully the knot will fall off the foot or toe.

4) Dispose of the thread, and thoroughly clean and disinfect the foot and your
tools.

I recommend starting with cases where it seems like the thread has not yet cut
into the foot. Unless you're ready to take a bird home with you and possibly
seek professional help, I recommend avoiding attempting to "treat" birds where a
toe looks like it's about to fall off, where skin has completely grown over a
loop of string, or where the pigeon seems to have fully adapted to their
stringfoot.
