We built this [project](http://pinpoints.io) for [Verdes](http://www.verdes.nyc/), a design and marketing firm in New York City. 

The engineers who built ReactJS were inspired by the efficiency and simplicity of the "DOOM" video game engine, so it's not surprising that React is a good tool for building responsive 3D websites. The PinPoints build convinced us that React's declarative components are a great fit for developing 3D user interfaces in the browser.
