### Monday, October 30th 2017

4AM: Wake up because I fell asleep with the lights on and my contacts in. Before
going back to sleep, I write for about forty minutes using the ThinkPad t440s
that lives on my desk. I've removed the laptop's bottom plastic enclosure
because of some sort of issue that caused the fan to randomly run at full power.
When the case is removed, the fan works normally. This computer is called
`daughter`, I bought it in college, when I was super obsessed with ThinkPads.

8AM: Wake up and spend about twenty minutes on my iPhone 6s catching up on
Slack. I call my iPhone `shitbird`, after a bedraggled pigeon I feed.  I'm
excited about an article my friend and colleague Willis has posted about medical
over-treatment and over-testing, it's related to the writing I was doing about
copays just a few hours earlier.

10:30AM: Arrive at the Computer Lab office in Tribeca. I don't look at my phone
on the train, instead I read the Wall Street Journal, though I do block out the
noise of the train using Bose QuietComfort noise cancelling headhpones, playing
music saved to YouTube Red. It's monday, so I spend about 45 minute performing
accounting tasks using my phone and my desktop tower computer, called
`largeson`.  I built it earlier this year, it's a beast with an 8 core CPU
running at XXGHz, 16GB of RAM, a graphics card, booting Ubuntu from 512GB M2
SSD. I deposit checks that arrived on Saturday, which puts me in an even better
mood.

Noon: Feed the pigeons and get a haircut.

1PM: Take a call from my desktop using Gotomeeting and my Plantrionics
headphones. I really want to find a headset that'll make my voice sound great in
all sorts of environments. The Plantronics headset's headphones aren't great
though.

2PM: Head back to Brooklyn to work at my friend's house. I code on my GPD
pocket, or `smolson`, which fits in the pocket of my coat. No need to carry a
bag!

6:15PM: Take a call with my friend in the parking lot of Costco.

8:30PM: Head a screening party with my GPD pocket (smolson). Hope that I'll get
a chance to write, but drink because I feel anit-social.
