### Monday, October 30th 2017

4AM: Wake up because I fell asleep with the lights on and my contacts in. Before
going back to sleep, I write for about forty minutes using the ThinkPad t440s
that lives on my desk. I've removed the laptop's bottom plastic enclosure
because of some sort of issue that caused the fan to randomly run at full power.
When the case is removed, the fan works normally. This computer is called
`daughter`, I bought it in college, when I was super obsessed with ThinkPads.

8AM: Wake up and spend about twenty minutes on my iPhone 6s catching up on
Slack. I call my iPhone `shitbird`, after a bedraggled pigeon I feed.  I'm
excited about an article my friend and colleague Willis has posted about medical
over-treatment and over-testing, it's related to the writing I was doing about
copays just a few hours earlier.

10:30AM: Arrive at the Computer Lab office in Tribeca. I don't look at my phone
on the train, instead I read the Wall Street Journal, though I do block out the
noise of the train using Bose QuietComfort noise cancelling headhpones, playing
music saved to YouTube Red. It's monday, so I spend about 45 minute performing
accounting tasks using my phone and my desktop tower computer, called
`largeson`.  I built it earlier this year, it's a beast with an 8 core CPU
running at XXGHz, 16GB of RAM, a graphics card, booting Ubuntu from 512GB M2
SSD. I deposit checks that arrived on Saturday, which puts me in an even better
mood.

Noon: Feed the pigeons and get a haircut.

1PM: Take a call from my desktop using Gotomeeting and my Plantrionics
headphones. I really want to find a headset that'll make my voice sound great in
all sorts of environments. The Plantronics headset's headphones aren't great
though.

2PM: Head back to Brooklyn to work at my friend's house. I code on my GPD
pocket, or `smolson`, which fits in the pocket of my coat. No need to carry a
bag!

6:15PM: Take a call with my friend in the parking lot of Costco.

8:30PM: Head a screening party with my GPD pocket (smolson). Hope that I'll get
a chance to write, but drink because I feel anti-social.

9:00AM: Get a ride back home to Bed-Stuy from Ridgewood. Decide to work from
home, since I'll be going to yoga in Greenpoint that evening. 

10:00AM - 6:00PM: Bill 4.5 hours for coding and research. Debug some issues
related to JSON Web Tokens. Auth is always tricky, and I find working from home
is often good for trying to figure out issues like this. Figure everything out
by the time I head to yoga.

9:30PM: Get out of yoga after a two-hour long class. I go across the street to get
some Japanese food. My phone is dead. I sit there a long time, drinking the
complimentary sake and reading the Wall Street Journal.

11:30PM: Get home and fall asleep after a shower.

### Wednesday, November 1st 2017

10:00AM: Wake up without an alarm. Wednesdays are a day off for me, or rather a
"hack day" where I don't really do billable hours. I like to break up the
work week like this.

10:30AM - 11:45AM: Buy a new phone plan and phone from the Verizon website. I've
wanted my own plan for a while, because although I get a better deal paying for
my part of my family's plan, my sibilings and I typically use up all the data
before the end of the month and get throttled. I'd rather have my own plan so
that I can use as much 4G LTE data as necessary, because I don't like connecting
to public WiFi networks and want to use my phone as a tether. At the last moment
I decide to get the iPhone SE (which has the same form factor of the iPhone 5,
but the processor of the 6s) instead of the iPhone 8. What's the point of having
a big phone when I have my `smolson`?

1:00PM: Head into the Computer Lab office.

2:00PM - 11:00PM: Spend most of the day using my `largeson` to research
health insurance options. Do a quick call about the coding work I did the day
before. Feed pigeons.
