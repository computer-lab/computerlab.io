I distinctly remember why I chose to become a software engineer. It was a difficult decision, a decision I agonized over for several years, disrupting my studies, health, and happiness. 

The first thing that became clear to me, as I paced through the woods procrastinating on an essay for my Freshman writing seminar, was that I did not want to do a job where my work output was PowerPoint slides, emails, speeches, contracts, etc.  I was actually *afraid* that sort of work could lead me to a full-on mental breakdown.

Professional athletes spend decades learning the basics of their sport, and then once they join a professional team, they spend the vast majority of their time practicing together - drills, mock scrimmages, etc. 

To win in business, a domain with high stakes and unclear rules, you and your team also need lots and lots of practice. The difference between sports and business, however, is that a company can't just go around trying to raise money with a pitch like "Hey, we're just doing this startup for practice, maybe in twenty years we'll have the network and knowledge required to do it for real. But we're looking for $5 million at a $30 million valulation, you interested?".
