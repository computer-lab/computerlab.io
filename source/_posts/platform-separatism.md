Many of my friends use one of three different social bookmarking services:
Are.na, Pinboard, and Pocket. Are.na is basically Pinterest for people who
fantasize about grad schoool instead of food. Pinboard is for a more
text-oriented type of egghead who cares about "sustainable software
engineering". Pocket is for people who still sincerely believe in the Apple
product vision.

Wikipedia has a nice list of over a dozen different active social bookmarking
services. All of these services implement the same core set of features, but
serve a very different userbase.

The coexistence of so many different bookmarking apps is an affront to the
venture capital community. Most important among these supposed truths is the
idea that industries will necessarily consolidate around .. (do I have a case
here? maybe the industry HAS consolidated around Pinterest).

online forums

Toxic Slacks
people stop thinking rationally

The utility provided by social bookmarking services is so simple that many
people don't get why they're even necessary.

not all platforms benefit from separatism

The current controversy about Facebook ... is certainly relevant to Platform
Separatism, but I'm sick of hearing about Facebook. The most important
implication of Platform Separatism, to me as a developer, is that it's now a
good time to look at the different ubiquitous platforms we use online, and
consider rebuilding them with a different community in mind.
