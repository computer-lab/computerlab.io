"...and the chat room she finds not so comforting. It's strange even with
friends, like sitting in a pitch-dark cellar conversing with people at a
distance of about fifteen feet."

-- William Gibson, Pattern Recognition

Platform Separatism is the idea that it's good to have multiple different
software platforms offering the same functionality. Platform separatists are
motivated by a wide range of greviances (or aspirations) both social and
technical: some want to fix bugs, some want to add features, some want to avoid
censorship, some want to prevent abuse, some want to avoid monetization, some
want make a more open platform, some want to make a more controlled platform.

Discussion about platforms has recently been dominated by concerns about
pervasive social network platforms.

Social platforms are not protocols. Social platforms are also not tools.

the alternative to a social software platform is often a communication protocol
or tool.

Many of my friends use one of three different social bookmarking services:
Are.na, Pinboard, and Pocket. Are.na is basically Pinterest for people who
fantasize about grad schoool instead of food. Pinboard is for a more
text-oriented type of egghead who cares about "sustainable software
engineering". Pocket is for people who still sincerely believe in the Apple
product vision.

It's a mistake to expect social platforms to consolidate in the same way that
software platforms did. Social platforms stratify and splinter.

Instead of focusing on whether currently popular social platforms like Facebook
and Twitter will remain popular forever, I think it's more interesting to pay
attention to smaller social platforms emerging and thriving.

Wikipedia has a nice list of over a dozen different active social bookmarking
services. All of these services implement the same core set of features, but
serve a very different userbase.

The coexistence of so many different bookmarking apps is an affront to the
venture capital community. Most important among these supposed truths is the
idea that industries will necessarily consolidate around .. (do I have a case
here? maybe the industry HAS consolidated around Pinterest).

What's the difference between a social platform and a software (computing)
platform?

alignment of interests is an asset

Is it impossible to create a generic social platform?

Marc Andreessen did a lot to define and popularize the idea of a software
platform, calling it 'a system that can be reprogrammed and therefore customized
by outside developers--users--and in that way, adapted to countless needs and
niches that the platform's original developers could not have possibly
contemplated, much less had time to accomodate'.

The distinguishing factor that makes something a social platform is a software
platform generic enough that it allows people to create their own social systems
on top of the 'platform'. In a post-dotcom-era forum, it was clear that the
persons in control of the forum's software was also t  and it's a platform and
not a tool or protocol because 1) you don't own it 2) you can't fork it

the platform provides something that is hard to replicate

the social platforms having issues are very generic

the existence of splinter social platforms provides value, it's not an
opportunity for market consolidation

Many of the difficulties social platforms currently face are a result of
these social platforms attempting to be good software platforms as well.

Some social platforms, by nature of the expectations they set, are also
excellent software platforms. For example, Pinboard itself doesn't offer or
maintain a mobile application, however, its APIs are unrestricted enough to
allow developers to build independent apps, such as Pinner on iOS and PinDroid
for Android.

Facebook owns its own splinter platform in the form of Instagram.

value provided by 

online forums

Toxic Slacks
people stop thinking rationally

The utility provided by social bookmarking services is so simple that many
people don't get why they're even necessary.

not all platforms benefit from separatism

The current controversy about Facebook ... is certainly relevant to Platform
Separatism, but I'm sick of hearing about Facebook. The most important
implication of Platform Separatism, to me as a developer, is that it's now a
good time to look at the different ubiquitous platforms we use online, and
consider rebuilding them with a different community in mind.
