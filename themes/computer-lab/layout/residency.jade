        p.page-description The Computer Lab residency is a six-week program that provides writers a desk within our office, technical support from the Computer Lab team, and opportunities to host or participate in events at our space. 
        p.attributes We're particularly interested in writers who hope to:
        ul
          li Experiment with the definition of literature
          li Criticize or explore the software industry
          li Self-publish
          li Create writing that organizes action online or irl
          li Explore the notion of "text as virtual reality"
