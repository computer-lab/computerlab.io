# Feature Post
feature_post_title: 'Adding Lookup Field to a Page in Dynamics NAV'
feature_post_date: 'April 5th, 2015'
feature_post_author: 'Patrick Steadman'
feature_post_path: "2015/04/05/lookup-on-page/"
feature_post_excerpt: 'One of the problems I faced in building a non-trivial application that consumed
NAV Web Services was figuring out how to “join” fields from different tables.
For example, when exposing a list of jobs from a job table which includes a
resource needed for the job, you might need more than just the resource id
that’s a field in the table: you might also need the resource name and
description.  While this is easy to get for one record, what about when you
need a few hundred records in a table that has been dynamically filtered?  When
exposing a Page as a web service, it’s easy to include the fields of the table
that the page is based on, but it’s less clear how to include fields from
another table.'
