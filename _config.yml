# Featured Note
feature_note_title: 'Using Ansible to Deploy Python Applications'
feature_note_date: 'April 18th, 2016'
feature_note_author: 'Max Fowler'
feature_note_path: "2016/04/18/flask-ansible/"
feature_note_excerpt: 'My new favorite tool is an Ansible template to quickly deploy a new Flask app to
Amazon Web Services.  It logs error messages to slack, has database
connectivity, and is fully idempotent — no need to remember server state. I find it very useful for getting small applications up and running quickly.
It is also useful for starting a new project to know from the onset that
deployment is already taken care of so I can focus on the actual project.'

# Featured Case Study
feature_case_title: 'Verdes Pinpoints'
feature_case_date: 'June 14th, 2016'
feature_case_author: 'Patrick Steadman'
feature_case_path: '2016/06/14/Pinpoints/'
feature_case_project_path: 'http://pinpoints.io'
feature_case_lede: 'We built an interactive 3D landing page for a marketing data visualization tool.'
feature_case_excerpt: 'The engineers who built ReactJS were inspired by the efficiency 
and simplicity of the “DOOM” video game engine, 
so it’s not surprising that React is a good tool for building responsive 3D websites. 
The PinPoints build convinced us that React’s declarative components are a great fit 
for developing 3D user interfaces in the browser.'
