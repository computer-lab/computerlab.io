# Feature Post
feature_post_title: 'Using Ansible to Deploy Python Applications'
feature_post_date: 'April 18th, 2016'
feature_post_author: 'Max Fowler'
feature_post_path: "2016/04/18/flask-ansible/"
feature_post_excerpt: 'My new favorite tool is an Ansible template to quickly deploy a new Flask app to
Amazon Web Services.  It logs error messages to slack, has database
connectivity, and is fully idempotent â€” no need to remember server state. I find it very useful for getting small applications up and running quickly.
It is also useful for starting a new project to know from the onset that
deployment is already taken care of so I can focus on the actual project.'
