# Featured Note
feature_note_title: 'Ten Inspiring Software Consultancies'
feature_note_date: 'January 4th, 2017'
feature_note_author: 'Patrick Steadman'
feature_note_path: "2017/01/03/inspiring-consultancies/"
feature_note_excerpt: 'One big thing I learned this year is that there’s no one right way
to run a software consulting business. I’ve tried to become a student of the industry, 
and in reading the blogs of successful companies, I’ve often found that the best practices
of one consultancy are considered anti-patterns at another. For example, some companies 
proudly call themselves Agile or Scrum teams, while others are defined by their rejection 
of Agile practices. Some groups care a lot about accounting and finance, while other 
companies outsource those concerns and focus on code or relationships.'

# Featured Case Study
feature_case_title: 'Verdes Pinpoints'
feature_case_date: 'June 14th, 2016'
feature_case_author: 'Patrick Steadman'
feature_case_path: 'blog/'
feature_case_project_path: 'http://pinpoints.io'
feature_case_lede: 'We built an interactive 3D landing page for a marketing data visualization tool.'
feature_case_excerpt: 'The engineers who built ReactJS were inspired by the efficiency 
and simplicity of the “DOOM” video game engine, 
so it’s not surprising that React is a good tool for building responsive 3D websites. 
The PinPoints build convinced us that React’s declarative components are a great fit 
for developing 3D user interfaces in the browser.'
