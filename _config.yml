# Featured Note
feature_note_title: 'What I Learned From Live-Tweeting My Google Searches'
feature_note_date: 'June 22nd, 2016'
feature_note_author: 'Patrick Steadman'
feature_note_path: "2016/06/22/what-i-learned-from-live-tweeting-google/"
feature_note_excerpt: 'Last May, I wrote a script that would log into my Google history page, find my most recent search queries, and tweet them from my public Twitter account. It tweeted searches from anywhere I was logged in with Google, including my phone, in real time.

I kept the script running continuously for over a year, generating about 17k tweets. A few nights ago, for various reasons, I decided to turn it off, and commented out the cron job that ran the script.

Frankly, I miss it.'

# Featured Case Study
feature_case_title: 'Verdes Pinpoints'
feature_case_date: 'June 14th, 2016'
feature_case_author: 'Patrick Steadman'
feature_case_path: 'blog/'
feature_case_project_path: 'http://pinpoints.io'
feature_case_lede: 'We built an interactive 3D landing page for a marketing data visualization tool.'
feature_case_excerpt: 'The engineers who built ReactJS were inspired by the efficiency 
and simplicity of the “DOOM” video game engine, 
so it’s not surprising that React is a good tool for building responsive 3D websites. 
The PinPoints build convinced us that React’s declarative components are a great fit 
for developing 3D user interfaces in the browser.'
